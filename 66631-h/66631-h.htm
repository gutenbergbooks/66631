<p class="ph1">After the Manner of Men</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">I<br />


<small>The Townlander</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COINCIDENT with a miniature thunderclap
shattering the summer afternoon silence of
the mountain forest a bullet whipped through the
foliage, leaving a half-severed twig to flutter and
dangle within easy arm&#8217;s reach. Tregarvon had
never before been under fire, and he was a product
of twentieth-century civilization and the
cities. Yet his colonial ancestor, figuring as a
seasoned Indian fighter in Braddock&#8217;s disaster,
could scarcely have picked his sheltering tree with
better judgment or dropped behind it with more
mechanical celerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Peter!&#8221; he exclaimed, under his breath,
struggling to draw the pocket-entangled weapon
which he had persuaded himself to add to his
impedimenta before leaving Philadelphia, under
the impression that it would be a necessary part
of a land-looker&#8217;s equipment in the Tennessee
mountains; &#8220;Great Pete&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>The pocket yielded with a sound of tearing
cloth, and the first shock of panic subsided.
Crouching behind his tree, the Philadelphian
twirled the cylinder of the revolver to make sure
that all the chambers were filled. While he was
doing this there was another report, and this time
the bullet scored the sheltering oak. Tregarvon
edged himself into position, with due regard for
the enemy&#8217;s line of fire, and cocked his weapon,
not, however, with any reassuring confidence in
it, or in his own steadiness of nerve.</p>

<p>Peering judiciously around the buttressing knees
of the barricade oak, he could see nothing save a
matted tangle of briers, blackberry bushes, and
laurel. But being the possessor of a fairly active
imagination, he fancied he could see more&mdash;the
sunlight reflecting from the polished barrel of a
rifle, for example, and, by another turn of the
imaginative screw, the indistinct figure of his assailant
far back among the trees.</p>

<p>While he was thus reconnoitring, a third shot
ripped through the screening laurel and clicked
spitefully into his oak. Since the click came first,
with the report a fraction of a second later, he reserved
his fire. It was evident that the hidden
marksman was well beyond pistol range, and he
decided to save his ammunition against a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
when it might stand a chance of being more effective.
The target-practice part of his education
had been neglected, and he especially distrusted
his marksmanship with the nickel-plated house
weapon, the more since he had never as yet fired it.</p>

<p>Harboring this distrust, he was content for the
moment to make himself small behind his tree,
sitting between two of the flanking root buttresses
with his back against the barrier trunk, and wincing
in spite of himself while other bullets, following
now in rapid and measured succession, whined
to right or left, or buried themselves in the solid
wood. Oddly enough, the misses, though he
could feel the wind of them on either side, were
less disquieting than the hits. At each impact
of lead against wood there was a jarring little
shock quite thrillingly transmissible to quick-set
nerves in sympathetic contact with the other side
of the target.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! if Elizabeth could only see me
now!&#8221; he chuckled broadly; &#8220;Elizabeth, or the
<i>mutterchen</i>, or even my rough-riding little sister!
This fusillading miscreant of mine must be one
of the McNabb outlaws, trying in his elemental
fashion to settle the old feud about our title to
the coal lands. By and by, I suppose&mdash; Whew!&#8221;</p>

<p>The spine-tingling thrill was so real this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
that he was half minded to look and see if the
impacting bullet had not come all the way through
the tree to bulge the bark on his side of it. But
he restrained the prompting and went on talking
to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;By and by, I suppose, he&#8217;ll get tired of blazing
away at a safe distance and come charging
down upon me. Then I shall be most unhappily
obliged to kill him; which will be about the
crassest misfortune that could happen, next to
his killing me. Confound their barbarous feuds,
anyway! Why can&#8217;t these out-of-date mountain
people wake up and realize that they are
living in the twentieth century of civilization and
Christian enlightenment? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like
to know!&#8221;</p>

<p>The only reply to this very reasonable query
being the vicious &#8220;ping&#8221; of another rifle-bullet,
he went on discontentedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if matters were not hopeless enough without
adding a scrap with these silly mountaineers
about the land titles! Everything torn up at
home, the family anchor pulled out by the roots
in the steel merger, two women to be taken care
of&mdash;with Elizabeth presently to make a third&mdash;and
nothing to make good on but this failure of a
Cumberland Mountain coal mine! And now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
before I&#8217;ve had time to turn around, the spirit
moves this rifle-popping moonshine-maker to
turn his grouch loose until I feel it in my bones
that I shall have to kill him to make him
quit!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, the <i>zip-zip</i> of the bullets beginning again
after a momentary pause, the soliloquy went on:
&#8220;That&#8217;s right; keep it up, you pin-headed barbarian!
I&#8217;ve got you for an excuse to commit
manslaughter&mdash;that&#8217;s the surest thing there is.
Which brings on more talk. I wonder how it
feels to kill a man? I&#8217;d give all my old shoes if
I didn&#8217;t have to find out experimentally. Then
there is Elizabeth: it is two completed generations
back to her Quaker forepeople, but she is
quite capable of flatly refusing to marry what
they would have stigmatized as &#8216;a man of blood.&#8217;
Say, you bloodthirsty assassin&mdash;that was an uncomfortably
near one!&#8221;</p>

<p>After the glancing shot, which had flicked a
handful of bark chips into Tregarvon&#8217;s lap, the
firing ceased. Assuring himself that the battling
moment at short range was approaching, the
young man from the North sat tight, gripping the
house pistol in nervous anticipation, and listening
tensely for the sound of advancing footfalls.</p>

<p>The suspense was short. Some one, several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
persons, as it presently appeared, were pushing
through the tangle of low-hanging undergrowth
toward the oak-tree. Tregarvon wondered that
there should be no attempt cautionary on the
part of the enemy; wondered again, this time
with nettle pricklings of foolishness, when a voice,
cheerfully exultant and unmistakably feminine,
cried out close at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you people&mdash;come here and see! I <i>did</i> hit
it&mdash;<i>lots</i> of times; not that trifling little sheet of
paper, of course&#8221;&mdash;scornfully&mdash;&#8220;but the tree, I
mean. Just come and&mdash; <i>Ee-e-ow!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The shrill little scream of surprise and alarm
was for Mr. Vance Tregarvon, issuing cautiously
from behind the bulwark oak, still mystified, and
still absently gripping the pistol.</p>

<p>The Philadelphian found himself confronting a
young woman gowned in stone-blue linen, and
wearing an embroidery hat to match, the hat
shading a face too unaffectedly winsome to be
called beautiful, perhaps, but yet the most piquant
and expressive face he had ever looked upon.
This young woman was carrying a target-rifle;
and pinned upon the bullet-punctured side of the
oak was the square of white paper at which she
had evidently been shooting.</p>

<p>There were others coming up to join the pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
markswoman: a lean-faced, mild-eyed, spectacled
gentleman of middle age, whose coat suggested
the church or the schoolroom; a vivacious lady
in black, with strongly marked eyebrows and eloquent
hands and shoulders; a young woman who
wore an artist&#8217;s smock over her walking-gown;
and another who was girlish enough to wear a
red tarn, and to be the prettier for it. But by
preference Tregarvon made his stammering apologies
to the blue embroidery hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;er&mdash;please don&#8217;t mind me,&#8221; he begged,
acutely conscious that his abrupt and pistol-bearing
entrance was handicapping him prodigiously.
&#8220;I thought&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash;you see, I really
couldn&#8217;t know that it was merely a peaceful target
practice, and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all things!&#8221; gasped the young woman, her
slate-blue eyes emphasizing her shocked amazement.
&#8220;<a id="shooting"></a>Did you really think that some one
was shooting at <i>you</i>? But, of course, you must
have! How perfectly dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was trying ineffectually to hide the
ornamental revolver in his coat pocket when the
others closed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure you are not hurt?&#8221; the mild-eyed
escort made haste to inquire, and Tregarvon
grinned sheepishly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;Only in my self-esteem,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;I
was silly enough to think that somebody was trying
to mark me down, though I might have known
better after the first shot or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could you know when you were behind
the tree and couldn&#8217;t see us?&#8221; protested the
one who had been doing the shooting. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
it speaks libraries for your self-control that you
didn&#8217;t retaliate in kind! Don&#8217;t you think so,
Madame Fortier?&#8221; and she appealed to the lady
with the Gallic eyebrows and the eloquent shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ciel!</i> but the <i>sangfroid</i>&mdash;what you call the
cold blood&mdash;of these American zhentlemen is of
a grandeur the moz&#8217; magnificent!&#8221; exclaimed
madame. &#8220;Mees Richardia she is shoot a hondred
time at zis zhentleman, and he is say he is
injure&#8217; onlee in hees <i>amour-propre</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this point that the humor of the
situation overtook the chief offender, and she
laughed, the sweetest and most delectable laugh
that ever gladdened the ears of a young man
keenly sensitive to the charms of heavenly slate-blue
eyes, a piquant face, and a voice remindful
of wood-thrushes and song-sparrows and golden-throated
warblers.</p>

<p>&#8220;After this, there is nothing left for us but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
declare ourselves,&#8221; she submitted ruefully, turning
to the spectacled escort. &#8220;It is the least we
can do to save the gentleman the trouble of describing
us if he wishes to have us taken before
Squire Prigmore.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now Tregarvon was regaining some measure
of equanimity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me be the one to begin the identifying
process,&#8221; he amended. &#8220;My name is Vance
Tregarvon, and I have the misfortune to be the
present owner of the valueless piece of property
known as the Ocoee Mine. You are more than
welcome to make a rifle-range of my landscape
any time you wish. I am quite certain it is the
only useful purpose it has ever subserved.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentleman whose coat was either clerical
or schoolmasterish, bowed gravely and took his
turn, prefacing it with a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard of Highmount College
for Young Women, Mr. Tregarvon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon, in deference to piquancies and
slate-blue eyes and the like, was tempted to
quibble and say that, of course, every one knew
of Highmount College. But the heavenly eyes
were holding him, and they promised intolerance
of anything but the pellucid truth. So he shook
his head regretfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Such is fame&mdash;the fame of an old, a great,
and a noble institution of learning!&#8221; said the spectacled
one, in mock deprecation. &#8220;With a foundation
laid over half a century in the past, with
the most healthful and charming location on the
entire Cumberland Mountain for its site; with
a corps of instructors second only to those of the
richly endowed colleges of the North&mdash;correct
me, Miss Richardia, if I am not quoting the prospectus
accurately&mdash;with all these splendid advantages,
and with a student body drawn from
the oldest and most distinguished families of the
South.... Mr. Tregarvon, can it be possible&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spare me!&#8221; laughed the victim. &#8220;You must
remember that I am only a poor, ignorant provincial
from Philadelphia, less than a fortnight
out of the shell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are merely trying to impress you properly
so that you will think twice before having
us arrested for trespass and attempted assassination,&#8221;
broke in the laughing markswoman. &#8220;We
may not look it, but we are a majority of the
faculty of Highmount College for Young Women.
Let me present you to Madame Fortier, Modern
Languages; to Miss Longstreet, Art; to Miss
Farron, Assistant Mathematics; and to Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
William Wilberforce Hartridge, M.A., Vanderbilt,
Higher Mathematics and the Natural
Sciences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon bowed in turn to the Gallic eyebrows,
to the artist&#8217;s smock, to the red tam-o&#8217;-shanter,
and shook hands cordially with the
M.A., Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is fine, you know; it&#8217;s like Robinson
Crusoe&#8217;s meeting with his rescuers,&#8221; he asserted
joyously. &#8220;This is my first real hearing of the
English tongue since I began doing time down
yonder in Coalville, with my old ruin of an
office-building for a dungeon, and Mrs. Matt
Tryon for my jail matron. Is it very far to
Highmount College? And may I hope sometime
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The three younger women laughed at this, and
Madame Fortier hastened to be hospitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be moz&#8217; charm&#8217;, Monsieur Tregarvong.
I will spik for President Caswell and hees
good madame.&#8221; But Tregarvon waited for Miss
Richardia&#8217;s confirmation, which was given unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, you must come, if you can spare
the time,&#8221; she affirmed. &#8220;We were speaking of
you, and of the Ocoee prospects, at dinner the
other evening, and Doctor Caswell was even then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
threatening to look you up. I think he said he
had met your father in years gone by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that was exceedingly kind and hospitable&mdash;to
think of taking the stranger up before
he had made himself known,&#8221; said Tregarvon,
with the hearth-warmed exile&#8217;s glow at his
heart. They were moving over to the rifle-rest,
and he had fallen a step or two behind with Miss
Richardia. &#8220;You would have to be a castaway
in a strange land yourself to know how good it
feels to be counted in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been both&mdash;the castaway and the
counted-in,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;I was four years in
Boston; two of them without knowing a single
soul outside of a limited little Conservatory
circle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, with the air of one who pats
himself on the back for his own perspicacity.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t introduce yourself a moment ago,
as you may remember, but I was sure you were
Music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you look it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harmony or discord?&#8221; she queried, with the
bright little laugh remindful of the bird songs.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you ask! Celestial harmony&mdash;no
less!&#8221; It was only a matter of a hundred yards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
between the oak-tree target and the firing-stand,
but they were getting on very well, indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Following that line of reasoning, you might
say that Miss Longstreet looks picturesque, I
suppose? And Miss Farron&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Farron is far too charming to warrant
any allusion to figures, mathematical or other,&#8221;
he retorted lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how about Professor Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon chuckled. &#8220;Is that what you call
him? I&#8217;m glad I have a Christian name that
can&#8217;t very well be nicked entirely out of all resemblance
to the original. Which reminds me:
have I got to call you &#8216;Miss Richardia&#8217;? It
sounds awfully formal&mdash;don&#8217;t you think?&mdash;in the
mouth of a man who has been familiarly shot at
by its possessor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better,&#8221; she replied calmly. &#8220;I am
&#8216;Miss Dick&#8217; in the classrooms; but that is the
student body&#8217;s privilege. Other people have to
earn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Consider me an employee from this moment,
if you please. I&#8217;m good at earning things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you earned the Ocoee property?&#8221; she
asked, altogether, as it appeared, by way of making
conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but my father did&mdash;very bitterly, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
turned out. May I ask what you know about
the Ocoee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only what every one knows: that it brings
sorrow and ruin to everybody who has anything
to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the rifle-stand, and Hartridge
was reloading the target-gun for Miss Farron.
There was still a little isolation for Tregarvon
and his companion, and the young man
made the most of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your words imply a lot more than they say,&#8221;
he suggested. &#8220;I shall take an early opportunity
to make my Highmount call, and when I do, perhaps
you will tell me some of the things I need
to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Hartridge or President Caswell can
tell you better than I can,&#8221; she demurred, as one
dismissing an unpleasant subject. &#8220;I only know
that the mine has always been a wretched failure;
first a thing of broken promises, and afterward a
cunningly devised pitfall for the unwary.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Tregarvon had for his major weakness the
love of women, he was not lacking such other
qualities as may go with broad shoulders, good
gray eyes set wide apart, a clean-cut face, and a
resolute jaw. The squareness of the jaw was emphasized
when he said: &#8220;This is the time when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the Ocoee quits being a failure, Miss Richardia.
It is up to me to make it a success, and I mean to
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this conjuncture that Miss Farron,
trying vainly to sight the rifle over the fallen-tree
firing-stand, broke in upon the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dickie, dear, do come here and hold your
hand over my left eye,&#8221; she called plaintively.
&#8220;It just persists in coming open to see what the
other one is trying to do.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br />


<small>The Sow&#8217;s Ear</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE rough-hewn world of mountain and
valley had taken on a distinctly cheerful
aspect for the young man from Philadelphia
when, late in the afternoon, he reluctantly separated
himself from the rifle-shooting party and
turned his steps valleyward to keep an appointment
made two days earlier with one Angus
Duncan, an old Scotch mining expert, upon whom
the great Southern title company, unlimited, had
long since conferred the brevet of &#8220;captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whatever the Tregarvon gray eyes and resolute
jaw promised in the way of decisive action
and stubborn determination, their possessor was
never born to be a contented anchorite. Not
even the matchless beauties of nature, arrayed
in all the glories of a Tennessee mountain September,
could atone for the solitude imposed by
the dead-alive hamlet of Coalville, and the newly
opened prospect of an occasional escape to the
congenial social atmosphere of the mountain-top
school was like the shadow of a great rock in a
thirsty land.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Tregarvon was planning the first of these
escapes, and forecasting the time which would
be consumed in freighting his motor-car down from
Philadelphia, when the forest path ended and let
him out among the deserted slope-foot buildings
and empty coke-ovens of the Ocoee. He glanced
at his watch. The up-train on the branch railroad
was due; it had doubtless announced its approach
by some distant crossing whistle, since the
little squad of village idlers had left its cantonments
under the porch of Tait&#8217;s store to straggle
across to the station platform.</p>

<p>Tregarvon remained on his own side of the railroad-tracks
and waited. He knew that Captain
Duncan&#8217;s visit would be discussed in all its possible
bearings in the idlers&#8217; caucus at Tait&#8217;s, and
he was willing to disappoint the country-store
gossips when it came in his way.</p>

<p>There were but few passengers to get on or off
at Coalville when the branch-line train rolled up
to the platform, and Tregarvon had no difficulty
in identifying his man; the stocky, ruddy-faced,
shrewd-eyed mining engineer who had been named
to him as the foremost coal expert in the Tennessee
field. He cut Duncan out of the group of
loungers at the instant of hand-shaking, and took
him across to the dilapidated building which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
once been the superintendent&#8217;s office and the commissary
of the Ocoee Company, seeking, and securing,
as he imagined, ear-shot privacy for the business
conference.</p>

<p>But privacy in a Southern country hamlet,
where gossip is as the breath of life to the isolated
few, is only to be bought with a price. From his
post of observation in Tait&#8217;s doorway, a lank,
bristly-bearded man in grimy jeans that had once
been butternut, marked the direction of the retreat
across the railroad-tracks, made a dodging
d&eacute;tour around the engine of the standing train,
and was safely hidden behind a thick clump of
althea bushes at the corner of the office-building
when Tregarvon and the Scotchman came leisurely
to sit on the door-stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re paying me for an expert opeenion, Mr.
Tregarvon, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m bound to gie ye,&#8221;
the engineer was saying. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known the Ocoee
ever since the first pick was piked intil it, and
ye&#8217;ll be wasting your time and money if you try
to develop it. That&#8217;s what I told your father,
and it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m telling his son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor coal? Or not enough of it?&#8221; Tregarvon&#8217;s
manner was that of a man desirous of knowing
the exact facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good coal&mdash;fine! It makes a coke that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
would run everything this side of Pocahontas,
or maybe Connellsville, out o&#8217; the market. And
there is enough of it if the two veins could be
worked as one. But there&#8217;s the bogie, Mr. Tregarvon;
two well-defined veins, each a foot and
a half thick, one above the other, and with six
foot of solid rock between. If you had twenty
such veins it wouldn&#8217;t pay to work them in this
part of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that the digging out of the rock
between the two coal seams would eat up all the
profits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was pulling ineffectually at his
short pipe. When he stooped to pluck a spear
of grass for a stem-cleaner he said: &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it
the notion of the earliest promoters that the two
veins would merge into one, farther back in the
mountain?&#8221;</p>

<p>The expert waved his hand toward the long
and costly inclined tramway running straight up
the steep slope of the mountain to the two black
openings at the foot of the cliff-line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;d think they believed in it&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t ye
now&mdash;to build that tramway on the strength of
it? Two hunner&#8217; thousand and better they put
in here, first and last; on the tramway and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
coke-ovens, the miners&#8217; houses, and this fine
office-building that&#8217;s crum&#8217;ling down behind our
backs! And with every practical coal man in
the country telling them that such a thing as two
veins&mdash;two separate veins, mind ye&mdash;coming into
one was a geological impossibeelity. Parker&mdash;the
man who set the trap and caught everybody&mdash;he
knew, I&#8217;m thinking; but Judge Birrell and all
the rest of &#8217;em were crazy&mdash;fair crazy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it a geological impossibility, Captain
Duncan? That is one of the questions I got you
up here to answer for me,&#8221; Tregarvon put in.</p>

<p>The Scotch engineer was too cautious to be
definitely oracular.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never been h&#8217;ard of yet,&#8221; he replied
shrewdly, &#8220;and there&#8217;s a many to tell ye that the
day o&#8217; merricles is past. But that isn&#8217;t all, Mr.
Tregarvon. Besides being a sow&#8217;s ear that ye
canna hope to make into a silk purse, the Ocoee
has another handicap. If ye had your coal in
profitable shape and quantity, ye&#8217;d never be allowed
to mine and coke and market it; never in
this warld.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would stop me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The C. C. &amp; I. Company, which is another
name in this part o&#8217; the warld for Consolidated
Coal&mdash;the trust. The combine owns all the producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
mines hereabouts; they&#8217;ve got one in
full blast at Whitlow, five miles above this. If
you should develop into anything worth while,
it would be another case of the lion and the lamb
lying down in peace together&mdash;with the Ocoee
lamb inside of the trust lion. They couldn&#8217;t
afford to lat ye operate. Your coke, for as much
of it as ye could make, would drive theirs out o&#8217;
the market.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said the Philadelphian.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d buy ye, if they could haggle ye down
to sell at a bargain; and, failing in that, they&#8217;d
break ye. I&#8217;m not questioning your resources,
ye unnerstand; that part of it was none of my
business after I&#8217;d had your check for my fee safely
in my pocket,&#8221; he threw in cannily. &#8220;But tell
me, now: if ye had your four or five or even six
foot of coal, are ye big enough in the way o&#8217; backing
and capital to fight Consolidated Coal wi&#8217;
any hope of coming out alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is as it may be,&#8221; said Tregarvon, wishing
neither to deny nor to affirm publicly. Then he
asked casually if the engineer could give chapter
and page proving the Cumberland Coal and Iron
Company&#8217;s policy of extermination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I no?&#8221; said the Scotchman, with a snap
of the shrewd eyes. &#8220;I can show ye wrecked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
mines by the handfu&#8217; in a day&#8217;s ride up and down
this same Wehatchee Valley we&#8217;re sitting in.
&#8217;Tis the power o&#8217; money, Mr. Tregarvon. When
ye get between the jaws o&#8217; that crusher, ye&#8217;re like
this&#8221;&mdash;picking up a bit of friable sandstone and
crumbling it in his palm.</p>

<p>The younger man smoked on thoughtfully for
a time. Then he said: &#8220;Two of the points upon
which I wished to have your opinion have been
covered pretty conclusively, it would seem. But
there is a third. What about this trouble with
the McNabbs over the land title?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Scotchman waved the third point away as
if it had been a buzzing fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The McNabbs are just a whiskey-making lot
of poor bodies living back in the Pocket beyond
Highmount. An unscrupulous lawyer-scamp got
hold of them when the second Ocoee Company
was fair rolling in money, and showed them how
they could trump up a claim to a wedge-like slip
o&#8217; land on the top o&#8217; the mountain which, if the
claim could be made good, would cut off the mine
a hundred feet or so back from the cliff. There
was neither sense nor justice in it, and the courts
said so. Ye&#8217;ll be having no trouble wi&#8217; the
McNabbs, unless one o&#8217; them might be taking a
pop at ye wi&#8217; his squirrel-gun some fine day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Tregarvon smiled, recalling his sensations while
Miss Richardia&#8217;s bullets were snipping bark
souvenirs from his sheltering oak.</p>

<p>&#8220;One wouldn&#8217;t be scared out by a little thing
like that,&#8221; he remarked half humorously. Then
he asked, quite abruptly, another question&mdash;the
chief question for an answer to which he had paid
the expert&#8217;s fee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been told, Captain Duncan, that you
have made an analysis of the Ocoee coals. Also,
I have been given to understand that no two
veins in these Tennessee coal-measures have exactly
the same characteristics; that the quality
of the coal varies with its distance from the original
surface, though the depth difference between
any two deposits may be very slight. If you
didn&#8217;t know of the existence of the six-foot layer
of stone lying between my two coal seams, would
you, or would you not, say that they were one
and the same?&#8221;</p>

<p>Duncan took time to consider before answering
the crucial question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what ye&#8217;re driving at, now,&#8221; he said at
length. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve paid me for a true answer, Mr.
Tregarvon, and much as I&#8217;ll hate to see your
father&#8217;s son banging his head against a stone wall,
I&#8217;ll give it ye. I&#8217;ve made half a dozen analyses:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
so far as they prove anything, the coal in the two
seams is the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; returned Tregarvon, drawing a
free breath as if a burden had been lifted from his
shoulders by the answer. And then, as a quavering
whistle blast announced the approach of the
down freight train on the branch: &#8220;There is your
return train, Captain Duncan. If I had any
hospitality to offer you, you shouldn&#8217;t go back
to Hesterville to-night. As it is, I know you&#8217;ll
be glad you don&#8217;t have to stop over in Coalville.
Even the name is a misnomer, it would seem.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grizzled Scotchman had discharged his
duty and earned his fee. But the cravings of
a purely Caledonian curiosity were still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;ll ye be doing, think ye, Mr. Tregarvon?&#8221;
he asked inquisitively.</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s answer was pointedly and purposefully
indifferent. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know definitely
yet. I may take a notion to butt my head against
the stone wall, and I may not. If I should, you&#8217;ll
doubtless hear of it. Good-by; it was mighty
good of you to take the trouble to come and talk
with me when you might have put me off with
a letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the leave-taking at the door of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
office-building was a fact accomplished, Tregarvon
prolonged it a little by walking across to the
station with Duncan. Thereby he missed a possible
chance of seeing the retreat of the man who
had been crouching behind the althea bushes,
the dodging run, first to the shelter of the row of
coke-ovens, and later to the lower fringe of the
Mount Pisgah forest, darkening now in the early
valley twilight.</p>

<p>Late that night, in his room in the cobwebbed
and dismantled office-building, Tregarvon wrote
two letters. The first was to a certain golden
youth in New York, a young man rejoicing in
the ancient and honorable name of Poictiers Carfax,
and whose father had left him more money
than he knew what to do with. Upon Carfax
Tregarvon leaned as upon a brother, having
shared rooms with the golden one in the university
at a period in which the Tregarvon family
check could also have been drawn for seven
figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always howling and taking on about
living the simple life,&#8221; was the opening phrase in
the letter to Carfax. &#8220;I wish you could be with
me to-night and have a taste of what it really is&mdash;ten
thousand miles from the Great White Way
or a decent beefsteak. I&#8217;d describe it for you if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
this were anything but a begging letter&mdash;which
it isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;First, I wish you&#8217;d send your machinist over
to Philadelphia and have him ship my car to me
here. Tell him to put in extras of everything,
from spark-plugs to tires, just the same as if he
were sending it to a man in Darkest Africa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next (and this is of more importance to me,
and perhaps less to you), I am going into a scheme
here which promises to leave me stony broke
before I shall have pulled half-way through the
experimental stage, and will possibly bankrupt
even the Carfax strong box when it fairly gets its
second wind. I may have to sell you some stock,
later on, and to that end I&#8217;ll be glad if you&#8217;ll keep
in touch&mdash;so that you may be &#8216;touched&#8217;&mdash;or at
least keep yourself within reach of a wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all I&#8217;m going to write, for the time
being, except to say that I&#8217;ve thought of you
about five times a minute during the past week,
and have tried to picture you in Coalville, hesitating
between suicide and a lingering death from
disgust. Come down and try it. I&#8217;ll go bail it
will give you an entirely new set of sensations.
What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>The second letter was to Miss Elizabeth Wardwell,
and it was a masterpiece in its way&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
way of a man who writes as he would talk, and
who talks when he would much better hold his
tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;The adventures began to-day,&#8221; so ran the
words of unwisdom. &#8220;While I was clambering
around on the mountain above the Ocoee opening,
<i>zip!</i> came a bullet&mdash;yes, an indubitable leaden
bullet fired from a gun&mdash;near enough to make me
dodge. What will you think of me when I write
it down in muddy black ink on white paper that
I hid behind a tree! I did, you know, and immediately
had plenty of reasons for being thankful
that the tree was big enough to cover me, and
thick enough through to stop a rifle-bullet.</p>

<p>&#8220;For fifteen minutes, or such a matter&mdash;though
it seemed a moderately long lifetime&mdash;my assassin
kept busy with the sharpshooting, and I
could feel myself growing smaller with every
fresh spat of a bullet into my tree. What did I
think? I thought of you, my dear Elizabeth,
and wondered if you&#8217;d keep your promise to
marry me in accordance with the terms of Uncle
Byrd&#8217;s will if I should be obliged to kill a man.
Would you?</p>

<p>&#8220;When it was all over, my assassins&mdash;it turned
out that there was a bunch of them&mdash;proved to
be a party of school-teachers from Highmount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
College shooting at a mark, which the same&mdash;though
I hadn&#8217;t seen it, and didn&#8217;t remotely suspect
its existence&mdash;was affixed to the farther side
of my tree. There were five people in the party;
three attractive young women, a French lady of
uncertain age, and a middle-aged professor in
spectacles doing escort duty. Of course, there
were explanations and apologies all around: I
had slipped out, cocked revolver in hand, with a
sort of &#8216;Now I&#8217;ll get you!&#8217; expression on my face,
I suppose.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were all very kind to me, especially
the young woman who had been doing the actual
shooting. I wish you could hear her laugh. It
is the sweetest thing in Tennessee. She has the
soft Southern voice, and a face that can be perfectly
wooden one minute and a whole insurrectionary
passion-stirring volume in the next.
No, Miss Wardwell, I didn&#8217;t make love to her.
How could I, with all the others standing about
and looking on and listening in?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to make myself free of the college, they
say, and perhaps I shall&mdash;later on. Please don&#8217;t
lift those matchless eyebrows of yours and ask
if I&#8217;m not going to wait at least until I have met
these people properly. If you could see my
present surroundings, and realize for one little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
instant what an elemental ruffian these same surroundings
are likely to make of me, you&#8217;d urge
me to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please write often. You can&#8217;t imagine how I
hang upon the arrival of your letters&mdash;how much
they mean to me.&#8221;</p>

<small>The Golden Youth</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was on the day following Captain Angus
Duncan&#8217;s visit that the hamlet of Coalville,
nestling at the foot of Mount Pisgah, took a fresh
start as an industrial centre. Word went out
from Tait&#8217;s store, which served as a general intelligence
exchange for the country roundabout,
that Tregarvon wanted laborers and would pay
good wages.</p>

<p>The men came; some from the half-tilled valley
farms, a few from the C. C. &amp; I. mines farther
up the railroad, and two or three mountaineers.
Two of the mountain dwellers, long-haired, unshaven
backwoodsmen, gave their names as Morgan
and Sill, suppressing, for some reason best
known to themselves, their surname of McNabb.
Also there came the lean, bristly-bearded man
who had squatted behind the althea bushes at
the corner of the office-building during Tregarvon&#8217;s
talk with Captain Duncan; James Sawyer,
by name. Tregarvon knew nothing of this man&#8217;s
antecedents; of the forehistory of any of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
for that matter. What he demanded was work,
and he went about securing it in the best of all
possible ways: by stripping off his coat and acting
as his own foreman.</p>

<p>In strenuous toilings fled the first two weeks,
during which period the old machinery was overhauled,
the tramway up the mountain repaired
and put in running order, and the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of disuse
cleared away. For the aggressive campaign a
deep-well drilling plant was secured in Chattanooga,
and upon its arrival all things were made
ready for transporting it to the top of the plateau
mountain.</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s plan, which he thought was original
with him, was to go back on the level mountain
top with his test-drill, and to sink a series of
holes down to the coal-measures. If the first
test should show the two veins still separated
by the stubborn ledge of intervening rock, he
would move the machinery farther back and try
again&mdash;and yet again, if need be; though of all
this he said no more to his workmen than was
necessary to enable them to help intelligently.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second week the drilling
machinery was hauled up the mountain, and
two days later, Uncle William, a solemn-faced old
negro with a narrow fringe of white wool ringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
his otherwise perfectly bald head, made his appearance
at Coalville.</p>

<p>He was waiting for Tregarvon on the Thursday
morning when the Philadelphian turned out to go
up the mountain with his working gang; waiting
to doff his battered hat and scrape his foot, and
to announce in honeyed tones that he had come
&#8220;ter tek cha&#8217;ge of de young marsteh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quite naturally, Tregarvon thought there must
be some mistake, and said so; but the old man
persisted with the velvety sort of pertinacity
which refuses to be denied, vaunting himself as a
body-servant of &#8220;the quality,&#8221; and acquiring, or
seeming to acquire, a curious hardness of hearing
when Tregarvon questioned him as to where he
had come from and who had sent him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, suh&mdash;yas, suh; cayn&#8217;t hear ve&#8217;y good on
dat side o&#8217; my haid&mdash;no, suh. But I&#8217;se suttin sho&#8217;
gwine tek mighty good keer o&#8217; you-all; I is dat,
marsteh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a body-servant is the last thing on earth
that I am needing here, uncle!&#8221; protested Tregarvon,
firing his final shot of objection. &#8220;If I
could find a good cook now, that would be more
to the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s it&mdash;dat&#8217;s it, suh. You-all jes&#8217; go &#8217;long
up de mounting and boss dem po&#8217; white trash,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and lef&#8217; ol&#8217; Unc&#8217; Wilyum ter fix up dat cook-house.
He gwine show you what quality cookin&#8217;
is; yas, suh; he will dat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon left the old man bowing and scraping
and backing away to take possession of the
deserted office-building and its detached cook-shanty;
and when he came back to the valley
in the evening he gasped to remember how near
he had come to incurring the penalty imposed
upon those who refuse to entertain angels in
disguise.</p>

<p>The old office-building was swept and garnished,
above and below. Out of the lumber-room in
the basement Uncle William had rescued a dining-table,
chairs, napery of a sort, and dishes; and
in the rear room, which had once been the office
of the Ocoee superintendent, a supper was spread,
hot, smoking, and appetizing enough to tempt a
sick man. Even the napkins, improvised for the
moment out of pieces of a flour-sack washed to
snowy whiteness, were not lacking; and when
the master would sit down, Uncle William was
behind him to whisk the chair away and to replace
it, with all the deftness of a trained butler.</p>

<p>Tregarvon ate and drank in grateful and heartfelt
silence down to the black coffee, which was
served, for the want of the proper crockery, in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
egg-cup, with a small fruit dish for a saucer.
Then he made the amende honorable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who you are, or where you came
from, Uncle William, but I owe you an apology,
none the less,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consider that I belong
to you for as long as you care to keep me&mdash;at
your own price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yas, suh; dat&#8217;s it&mdash;dat&#8217;s jes&#8217; de way de quality
talk to ol&#8217; Unc&#8217; Wilyum, eve&#8217;y time&mdash;<i>hyuh! hyuh!</i>
&#8217;Long erbout an hour o&#8217; sun, white woman comed
ercross f&#8217;om dat white-niggah cabin turrer side
de big road, and she say: &#8216;I gwine fix up Mistoo
Tregarbin&#8217;s suppeh.&#8217; <i>I</i> say, &#8216;Mistoo Tregarbin
&#8217;sents his compliments an&#8217; say t&#8217;ank you kin&#8217;ly,
but he done got he own body-sarvant!&#8217; Yas,
suh; dat&#8217;s what I done tol&#8217; <i>huh</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be getting yourself disliked, Uncle
William, if you put on your quality manners with
Mrs. Tryon and her kind. They tell me that this
county was Republican during the war.&#8221; Then
he added: &#8220;Are you ready to tell me now who
sent you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man was clearing the supper-table, and
he seemed to have entirely misunderstood the
query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat ol&#8217; cook-house? Yas, suh; it sholy did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
try me for to git dat ol&#8217; chimley ter mek de fiah
bu&#8217;n for de supper-fixin&#8217;s. Ter-morrer I gwine
chink him up some; yas, suh, I sholy is.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Uncle William&#8217;s mysterious advent the
work on the mountain progressed the more rapidly
by precisely the difference between a well-fed
leader and an ill-fed. Tregarvon and his pick-up
crew wrought manfully, and on the eighteenth
day&mdash;the day of fresh surprises&mdash;the drilling
machinery had been safely transported to the
plateau, had been set up, and was ready to be
started on the test upon which the Tregarvon
hopes were building airy structures of future
affluence.</p>

<p>At quitting-time on this eighteenth day of
preparatory toil Tregarvon came down in a tram-car
with his men and, after the dispersal at the
mountain foot, stood for a moment on the office-building
porch to let the quiet grandeur of the perfect
autumn evening soak in and wash the work-weariness
out of his jaded brain and muscles.</p>

<p>The sun had gone behind the mountain for all
the lower reaches of the valley, but its level rays
were still pouring in a flood of yellow light across
the flat-topped promontory crowned by the buildings
of Highmount College. Pisgah, densely forested
on slope and summit, loomed vast as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
early shadows rose like silently drawn curtains to
soften its rugged detail, and on the sky-line Tregarvon&#8217;s
gaze sought and found the derrick skeleton
of his drilling plant struck out in rigid lines
of black against the hazy blue. Just above him
the tramway cut its steeply ascending gash through
the forest of the slope, and in his mind&#8217;s eye he
could see the cars descending, each with its load
of the reopened mine&#8217;s largesse, to be dumped
upon the receiving-platform beside the row of
coke-ovens.</p>

<p>From the outlined derrick to the sun-illumined
college buildings was an airy leap of a mile or
more. Tregarvon had not as yet used his invitation,
though the French teacher&#8217;s giving of it
had been promptly confirmed by a cordial note
from the president&#8217;s wife. The social hunger rose
strong in the expatriated townlander as he let
his eyes make the leap from the industries, typified
by the derrick skeleton, to the possible relaxations
harboring on Highmount. He meant to
go; he promised himself afresh that he would go,
the moment his motor-car should arrive and be
put into commission to make the five-mile climb
up the mountain pike from Coalville something
less than an added weariness after a hard day&#8217;s
work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>He was still looking longingly up to the sun-shot
heights and wondering why he had heard
nothing from Poictiers Carfax, when a sound,
breeze-blown up the valley, made him start and
listen. When he heard it again it was nearer;
the unmistakable roar of an automobile&#8217;s engines
with the muffler cut out. To confirm the witness
of the ear, a big yellow car presently topped the
rise in the valley road below the village and
came bounding over the roughnesses of the country
wagon track toward the railroad crossing.</p>

<p>Tregarvon immediately recognized his own car
and the cacophonous thunderings of it; but it
was only a guess that the slender young man in
dust-coat and goggles behind the steering-wheel
was Carfax; that the square-shouldered fellow in
a leather jacket and closely fitting cap beside him
was the machinist; and that the liveried person
sitting bolt upright with folded arms in the exact
centre of the tonneau seat was Merkley, Carfax&#8217;s
imported valet.</p>

<p>Tregarvon gasped, and his hands went up in
the gesture of a man vainly striving to avert a
crash of worlds. &#8220;Great Heavens!&#8221; he ejaculated.
And at that moment Jefferson Walters,
acting chairman of the convention of idlers in session
under the awning of Tait&#8217;s store porch, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
himself an imaginary errand to Tryon&#8217;s, across
from and a little beyond the Ocoee office-building,
timing his saunter to bring him upon the scene as
an interested onlooker when the yellow car rolled
up to Tregarvon&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit do beat the Dutch&mdash;what-all gits up in
the big woods when you ain&#8217;t totin&#8217; a gun,&#8221; he
remarked to the executive session when he returned
to the other side of the railroad. &#8220;Young
feller with the eye-glasses&mdash;he must be powerful
nigh blind to have to wear sech big ones&mdash;he
pulls up the team with a jerk at a han&#8217;le, and
says: &#8216;Hello, Vance! Here we are; the dog and
the tail, and the tail wagging the dog.&#8217; And Tregarvon,
he jest shets his fists tight and says, sort
o&#8217; hoarse-like, &#8216;My Lord, Putters&#8217;&mdash;&#8217;r some sech
name as that&mdash;&#8216;did you tool that car all the way
down here from Philadelphia?&#8217; &#8216;Sure, I did,&#8217;
says Goggles; and all the while that there circus
ringmaster was a-settin&#8217; up like he&#8217;d growed with
a hick&#8217;ry saplin&#8217; down his back, lookin&#8217; straight
out ahead of him as if he didn&#8217;t know that anything
was happenin&#8217;,&#8217;r was ever goin&#8217; to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;President o&#8217; the new Ocoee Comp&#8217;ny, d&#8217; ye
reckon?&#8221; queried one of the listeners.</p>

<p>&#8220;President o&#8217; nothin&#8217;! I&#8217;m comin&#8217; to him,
right now. &#8216;And you brought Merkley?&#8217; says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Tregarvon, speakin&#8217; right low and soft, and
chokin&#8217; some more. &#8216;Naturally,&#8217; says Goggles,
as cool as a cucumber, and then he climbs out and
goes in with our man, with the ringmaster feller
<i>totin&#8217; the carpet-bags</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; chirruped the oldest man in the
circle, a wizened veteran of the Mexican War.
&#8220;I seed &#8217;em in the army; the West Pointer
gin&#8217;rals had &#8217;em&mdash;called &#8217;em val-lays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what-all our young feller over
yander&#8217;ll turn up next?&#8221; mused Jabez Layne,
bringing his huge jack-knife to bear upon a
pocket-worn nugget of plug tobacco.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll turn up a heap o&#8217; trouble ef he don&#8217;t
quit hirin&#8217; them McNabbs,&#8221; volunteered one of
the valley men who had hitherto been speechless.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got two of &#8217;em in his gang now&mdash;Morgan
an&#8217; Sill; an&#8217; ef they don&#8217;t git him afore he gits
the coal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, the C. C. &amp; I.&#8217;ll git him about
five minutes afte&#8217;wards,&#8221; laughed Walters, breaking
in to complete the sentence in his own way.</p>

<p>Thus ran the leisurely comment in the gray of
the evening, working its way from man to man
among the loungers on Tait&#8217;s porch. But in the
dilapidated office-building across the railroad-tracks
there was consternation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;Why, Poictiers, old man, you can&#8217;t endure it
for twenty-four hours!&#8221; Tregarvon was protesting
anxiously. &#8220;Look at this place&mdash;a dusty,
cobwebby ruin that a self-respecting tramp
wouldn&#8217;t lodge in! Heavens, man! couldn&#8217;t you
see a joke when it was written out plain with a
pen and ink? I would have as soon invited
Elizabeth&mdash;meaning it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax had slipped out of his dust-coat and
goggles, the valet assisting, and stood revealed
as a handsome young fellow, a shade too well-groomed,
perhaps, but with smiling good-nature
atoning for the Carfax millions in every line of his
beardless and almost effeminate face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that is what I call downright inhospitable,&#8221;
he laughed, with the faintest suspicion of a
lisp on the sibilants, &#8220;after you had written me to
come. Your letter is out in the go-cart, if Merkley
didn&#8217;t forget to put it in my letter-case. Also,
after I&#8217;ve driven that unspeakable car of yours
over a thousand miles of the worst roads the rain
ever rained on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good Lord, Poictiers&mdash;you&#8217;re welcome;
as welcome as the sunshine! Don&#8217;t rub it into
me that way. But the place; the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s smile was cherubic; or rather it would
have been if the womanish lines of his face had
not made it seraphic.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;No apologies, you inexpressible old coal-digger.
I knew you were only joking when you
asked me&mdash;or rather dared me&mdash;to come down.
But the notion seized me, and here I am. Here,
likewise, is Rucker, the machinist, who will happily
shift for himself; and what is more serious,
perhaps, here also is Merkley. In all human
probability I shall bleat like a sheep at the corn-pones
and the hardtack, and all that; but Merkley
was once in the service of the Duke of Marlford
and his agonies&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon laughed, and the stresses came off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Luckily, I have acquired Uncle William, or,
perhaps I should say, he has acquired me, since I
wrote you, and you won&#8217;t starve, whatever happens
to Merkley. Find your way up-stairs and
take possession, while I tell the old uncle what he
is up against in the way of supper-getting. You&#8217;ll
find a bath, with ice-cold mountain spring water&mdash;my
one luxury&mdash;at the end of the upper corridor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Considering his resources, which were few and
strictly limited, Uncle William shed a lustre all
his own upon the dinner for two, which was served
in the makeshift dining-room as soon as Carfax
came down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you needn&#8217;t find fault with your
table,&#8221; was the guest&#8217;s comment, when the snowy
biscuits and the egg-bread, the fried chicken and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the riced potatoes had passed in review. &#8220;I only
wish I could induce an Uncle William to adopt
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the master; but the London-bred man
was not faring so well. It was Uncle William&#8217;s
effort to orient the valet&mdash;an effort vocalizing itself
through the screened windows of Tregarvon&#8217;s
dining-room&mdash;that reopened the question of the
practicabilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is you-all dat gemman&#8217;s white niggah?&#8221; was
the blunt demand, made when Merkley, dinner-inclined,
ventured into the sacred precincts of
Uncle William&#8217;s detached cook-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;H-I am Mr. Carfax&#8217;s man, and h-I&#8217;ll trouble
you to serve my dinner,&#8221; was the lofty reply, returned
in Merkley&#8217;s best tone of aloofness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s askin&#8217; ef you is dat gemman&#8217;s white niggah!&#8221;&mdash;scornfully.
&#8220;Ef you is, you jes&#8217; sots
youse&#8217;f down on dat door-step an&#8217; waits, same as
any turrer niggah. When de quality folks gets
t&#8217;rough, an&#8217; <i>I</i> gets t&#8217;rough, den you kin have
what&#8217;s lef&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax waved a shapely hand toward the open
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;The irrepressible conflict has begun,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;What do you do in such cases in&mdash;er&mdash;Coalville?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;We go down on our knees, metaphorically
speaking, and plead with an outraged and righteously
indignant Uncle William,&#8221; Tregarvon
laughed; and when the old negro made his next
appearance in the dining-room, the Philadelphian
did it so skilfully that Merkley was provided for
at a side table in the hall; not of grace, as certain
mumblings from the cook-house proved, but because
the master desired it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles our status,&#8221; said Carfax, with the
cherubic smile, &#8220;at least down to Rucker, the
mechanician. I wonder what has become of
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is the same mechanical barbarian you
had last year, he&#8217;ll not go hungry,&#8221; Tregarvon
ventured; and then, with the assurance of a tried
friend: &#8220;Whatever possessed you to come down
here <i>en suite</i>, Poictiers? Did I give you the impression
that the Ocoee headquarters was a summer-resort
hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax laughed joyously. &#8220;You certainly did
not. But I was tired of Lenox, and it was too
early for the shooting. Moreover, you said you
wanted your car, and the fit took me to drive it.
That accounts for Rucker; and I suppose I account
for poor Merkley. He is due to have the
time of his gay young life&mdash;don&#8217;t you think?&mdash;with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Uncle William and the elemental environment?
But tell me more about your affair.
What have you been letting yourself in for, down
here in the Southern backwoods?&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle William had removed the cloth, and had
put a tobacco-jar and two pipes on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the best we can do, even for you,&#8221; said
Tregarvon, indicating the tobacco aftermath
apologetically. &#8220;Nobody has ever seen a bottle
of wine in Coalville, and the whiskey of the country
isn&#8217;t fit to drink.&#8221; Then he plunged abruptly
into the story of the Ocoee, so far as he knew it,
giving the last-resort reasons why he was trying
to make a family windbreak of it, and Carfax
heard him through patiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it sums itself up about like this: You
haven&#8217;t anything at present, and if you succeed
in getting anything, the other fellows will nab it,&#8221;
he said, when Tregarvon had finished. &#8220;Is that
about the size of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have surrounded it completely. Only I
am eliminating the &#8216;if.&#8217; I mean to get something,
and I don&#8217;t mean to let the other fellows
get away with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any move made yet?&#8221; queried Carfax, between
delicate little puffs at the pipe of hospitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not visibly. The trust people will scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
move in the matter until after I have proved my
first proposition, which is that the two veins of
coal become one farther back in the mountain.
But the McNabbs may not wait that long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are the McNabbs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon explained again, at some length,
not omitting mention of a mysterious leaf fire
which had threatened to destroy a tramway trestle,
and other small accidents which had somewhat
impeded the work of the past fortnight, and
which were blankly unaccountable save upon a
theory of somebody&#8217;s malice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you buy &#8217;em off?&#8221; said Carfax
casually. Money was his cure-all for most human
ills.</p>

<p>&#8220;For one reason, they haven&#8217;t given me a
chance. For another, I don&#8217;t propose to be held
up and robbed. They haven&#8217;t any title to the
land; they have never had a shadow of a title.&#8221;
Then he broke off suddenly, glanced at his watch,
and changed the subject. &#8220;How much too tired
are you to take a five-mile spin with me up the
mountain in the car, Poictiers?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s eyebrows went up in mild surprise.
Nevertheless, he said: &#8220;Call it a go&mdash;if you can
find Rucker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind Rucker; I&#8217;ll drive you myself,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
said Tregarvon, and a few minutes later the big
car, with its dazzling headlamps picking out the
way, was storming up the steep grades of the
Pisgah pike to Highmount.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br />


<small>In Which Carfax Enlists</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the broad veranda of the administration
building at Highmount, which looked down
sidewise upon the twinkling light or two of Coalville
and faced on even terms an opposing shoulder
of the mountain where the newly erected
drill derrick stood, Carfax was holding Miss
Farron and four privileged members of the
senior class at bay, while Tregarvon contentedly
monopolized Miss Richardia Birrell.</p>

<p>The two thus comfortably isolated had quickly
exhausted the commonplaces. Tregarvon was
made to know thus early that one of Miss Richardia&#8217;s
charms was her ability to plunge at once
into the heart of things; and the talk had turned
upon Carfax, distance and the hubbub of the
others sanctioning personalities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know him yet,&#8221; Tregarvon
protested, in refutation of a remark of Miss Birrell&#8217;s
based upon Carfax&#8217;s apparent satisfaction
with his present besetment. &#8220;He is anything but
a butterfly, in the meaning you imply; and I say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
this in spite of his pretty face and airy gabble,
and the lisp and his bad habit of slipping instinctively,
as you might say, into the easiest
chair in sight. I&#8217;ve summered him and wintered
him, and I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like loyalty,&#8221; said Miss Richardia, with
the air of one to whom abstractions are as daily
bread. &#8220;Are you going to winter him in Coalville?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such good luck as that for me, I&#8217;m afraid.
After the shooting begins, I don&#8217;t imagine he has
a week untaken. You may not believe it, but
Poictiers is in demand&mdash;where he is known and
appreciated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure we shall appreciate him,&#8221; was the
half-mocking rejoinder. &#8220;Young men who come
to Highmount driving their own tonneau cars
are not so plentiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s laugh was not more than decently
boastful.</p>

<p>&#8220;This particular tonneau car happens to be
mine,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Besides, Carfax might
discount your praise. His latest purchase is an
imported Dumont-Sillery, I believe. It probably
cost three times as much as mine; and on
the other side of the water, at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How easily and familiarly you talk of imported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
luxuries and &#8216;the other side&#8217;,&#8221; she commented,
still in the mocking vein. And then,
with an exactly proportioned touch of wistfulness:
&#8220;I wish I might have a glimpse into your
world; the world you have turned your back
upon&mdash;temporarily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon slid into this little pitfall without
realizing that it had been digged especially for
him, thus proving that social hunger may be as
blind as any of the other appetites. So far from
suspecting pitfalls, he was thinking that there
were many less enjoyable diversions than sitting
in a moderately secluded corner of a dimly lighted
veranda in the company of a young woman who
was kind enough to evince an interest in a chance
visitor&#8217;s proper sphere.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not such a very high-planed world, the
one I&#8217;ve left behind, Miss Richardia; not nearly
as human as this of Coalville and Mount Pisgah,&#8221;
he returned. &#8220;I believe I have seen more real
human nature in the past three weeks than I
had ever seen before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that the other world is artificial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is; without intending to be, especially.
We are not elemental any more; not even in
our passions. We do things in a certain well-defined
way because that is the way other people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
do them. We are afraid, or at least disinclined,
to strike out on new lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have struck out on a new line, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been pushed out, in this Ocoee matter.
There is enough of the elemental surviving in
me to make me break with traditions and become
a hustler when it is a question of bread
and meat for my mother and sister. But apart
from that, I suppose I am quite as hidebound
as other men of my world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Carfax?&#8221; she queried. &#8220;Is he a
slave to conventions, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poictiers is a law unto himself in a good many
ways; but on the whole, he&#8217;s tarred with the
same stick. You will remark his regalia: I
couldn&#8217;t have pulled him up here to-night with
a three-inch hawser if he hadn&#8217;t happened to
have evening clothes in his kit. And he has
brought his man; a typical Cockney valet, knee-smalls,
Oxford ties, and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Richardia&#8217;s quiet laugh fitted the incongruity.
But when she spoke again it was of the
business affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are at work on the Ocoee?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! I am going to make a spoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
or spoil a perfectly good horn. You must all
come over and see my test-drilling outfit when
we get it going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it your machine that we can see over beyond
the glen? I wonder if you could make me
understand what you are going to do?&#8221; she
said, with interest real or so skilfully feigned
that Tregarvon could not distinguish the difference.</p>

<p>He expressed himself as being very willing to
try; did try at some considerable length. And
Miss Birrell, notwithstanding an air of abstraction
that seemed to come and go, appeared to
grasp the mechanical details.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no doubt that you will succeed?
It will be fine to prove to everybody that all that
was needed was for some one to come from the
other world&mdash;your world&mdash;to show them how
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon winced, seeing now the pitfall into
which he had suffered himself to be led.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the impression I&#8217;ve been giving you?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Do I advertise myself as such a
blooming bounder as that would signify?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; she said, with a little laugh
which might have meant anything from veiled
ridicule to a keen appreciation of a palpable hit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
&#8220;I suspect it is the way of your world to be
austerely sufficient unto itself. You may contradict
me if I am wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; he exclaimed generously. &#8220;You
are as much of my world as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she objected: &#8220;we are only poor
outlanders. I was called that once, in Boston;
not spitefully, of course, but rather as an excuse
for my shortcomings, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever said it was a snob,&#8221; he exploded.
&#8220;Boston is horribly provincial, at times, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Philadelphia never is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t dare to make the claim too broad.
But I am sure we recognize the fact that there is
an America west of the Alleghenies&mdash;and south
of Mason and Dixon&#8217;s line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is charitable, at least,&#8221; she conceded.
&#8220;Still, you think it is left for you to demonstrate
success where others have failed&mdash;in the Ocoee
undertaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of it in that way,&#8221; he answered,
with due modesty. &#8220;Indeed, I know
little or nothing about the early history of the
mine. My father became interested in it some
years before he died, and I think he always regarded
it as a dead loss. But he bought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
stock, or rather, I should say, had it forced upon
him, when it was pretty cheap, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she interrupted, a little forbiddingly,
he thought; and then she began to speak of
other things as if groping for a more congenial
common ground. It was found when Tregarvon
confessed to an amiable weakness for good music.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play for you if you wish,&#8221; she said almost
abruptly; and it was an hour later when
Carfax entered the music-room to break the
spell which Miss Richardia had woven about
her single listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do this again, but not too often,&#8221;
was Tregarvon&#8217;s half-jesting warning to his
entertainer at the moment of leave-taking; a
moment snatched while Carfax was giving the
privileged seniors a spin around the campus
drive in the yellow car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not often?&mdash;or as often as you care to
come?&#8221; the musician asked indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am much too impressionable.
You could very easily make me forget some
things that it is up to me to remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For example?&#8221; she prompted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story, and Poictiers won&#8217;t give
me time to tell it now. But some other evening,
if I may come?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t you come when you feel like
it? I hope you won&#8217;t go away underestimating
your welcome&mdash;you and Mr. Carfax. You owe
it to us to come frequently, so that the novelty
will wear off&mdash;for the student body. I&#8217;ll venture
to assert that Miss Longstreet has been
having the time of her life keeping order in the
dormitories this evening. Good night; and give
my love to Uncle William.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Uncle William? Then you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and showed him that Carfax was
waiting for him. &#8220;Uncle William will know who
sent the message if you say &#8216;Miss Dick&#8217;,&#8221; she
explained; and he was obliged to accept this as
an answer to his eager question.</p>

<p>The road down the mountain was a speeding
track only in spots, and between stretches the
big car crept at a snail&#8217;s pace on the brakes, and
so permitted conversation.</p>

<p>Carfax began it in genial raillery, congratulating
Tregarvon upon the accessibility of Highmount
and the very evident heartiness of his
welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t desiccate entirely down here,
Vance, with such a well-spring of youth and
beauty as that within shouting distance,&#8221; he
remarked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>But Tregarvon was thinking pointedly of Miss
Richardia when he rejoined: &#8220;She is a puzzle
to me, Poictiers; nothing less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The charming music teacher, you mean?
Peaches-and-cream, I&#8217;d call her, if she&#8217;d let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re blind; blind as a mole!&#8221; retorted
Tregarvon. &#8220;Why, man! she is anything but
that&mdash;or those.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; Carfax laughed. &#8220;They are all
&#8216;anything but that&#8217; when you get down under
the pose. But &#8216;peaches-and-cream&#8217; is Miss Birrell&#8217;s
pose, just the same; not the conventional
kind they serve you at the Waldorf or Ritz-Carlton,
of course, but the sort you get when
the cream comes thick and rich from your own
dairy, and the peaches are picked, sun-warm,
in your own orchard. You may tell her that,
if you like, and palm it off as original with you.
Strikes me it&#8217;s rather neat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you go hang!&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
have to work in your compliments, second-hand.
I can turn &#8217;em myself, at a pinch.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point a half-mile of good road beckoned
for speed, and the talk was interrupted. When
it was resumed at the next curving hazard in
the pike, Carfax had somewhat to say about the
Ocoee.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;What do you know about the ancient history
of your mine, Vance?&#8221; he asked, when the
topic was fairly launched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much, in detail. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was asking for information. President Caswell
was speaking of it while you were in the
music-room with Miss Birrell. He came out and
sat with us for half an hour or so. There is a
mystery of some sort connected with the Ocoee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;The mystery is
six feet thick, and it consists of a layer of good
solid sandstone. I&#8217;m about to penetrate it with
a test-drill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; Carfax objected.
&#8220;It is another kind of mystery. I&#8217;ll tell you what
Doctor Caswell said, and you may draw your
own conclusions. We had been talking about
superstitions and their hold upon humanity. I
was scoffing, as usual, but the president seemed
inclined to a belief that Providence or fate, or
whatever you wish to call it, does interfere sometimes;
and that these interferences form a basis for
some of the convictions we call superstitions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which would seem to be a good many
miles from a pair of coal seams made profitless
by a stone &#8216;horse&#8217; between them,&#8221; suggested
Tregarvon mildly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming to that; the distance isn&#8217;t so
great as it may seem. The doctor rode his notion
as if it were a hobby. He spoke of the well-grounded
belief in the saying that &#8216;murder will
out,&#8217; and insisted that the facts proved the truth
of this saying; facts which were often mysterious.
Then he referred to that other pet notion of the
bulk of mankind: that misfortune pursues the
possessor of ill-gotten gains. To my astonishment,
he pointed to your Ocoee property as an
example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dickens he did!&#8221; exclaimed Tregarvon,
with interest suddenly awakened. &#8220;How did he
make the Ocoee fit in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the peculiar part of it. When I betrayed
my complete ignorance of matters Ocoeean
by beginning to ask questions, he shut up like a
clam. All I could get out of him was an assertion
that misfortunes had accompanied every
succeeding attempt to open the mine, and that
they would doubtless continue to follow until
justice was done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But justice to whom?&#8221; queried Tregarvon.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t let it rest at that, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried not to, but he gave me a dignified
cold shoulder and referred me to you; said you
doubtless knew all the circumstances, and would,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
he hoped, take proper steps toward removing
the curse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The descent of Pisgah was accomplished, and
Tregarvon steered the yellow car into an empty
warehouse which was to be its garage.</p>

<p>Later, when he was showing his guest to the
sleeping-room made ready for him by Uncle
William, he said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to pull you into
this thing with me blindfolded, Poictiers. If
there is a skeleton in the Ocoee closet, I&#8217;ll have it
out and give it decent Christian burial before I
ask you to back me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this, Carfax appeared at his multi-millionaire
best.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort, old man. You
will find me some old clothes to-morrow morning
and we&#8217;ll go up and set your test-drill at work.
Further along, when more money is needed, I&#8217;ll
go somewhere to a bank and turn the fortunate
spigot. We&#8217;ve got to make a go of your mine
now, if only to show Doctor Caswell that the
superstitions can&#8217;t prove up on this particular
homestead.&#8221;</p>

<small>Partly Sentimental</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARFAX&#8217;S promise to stay and see the
Ocoee experiment fairly on its feet was
made in good faith, as the idlers at Tait&#8217;s store,
and more than these, a London-bred and disconsolate
Merkley, were shortly given to understand.
Moreover, the golden youth&#8217;s threat of
wearing old clothes and dipping into the crude
mechanical processes of the experiment was also
carried out; which not only deepened Merkley&#8217;s
conviction that he had attached himself to a
mild-mannered lunatic of a peculiarly American
type, but left him without an occupation&mdash;a
mere fragment of urban flotsam eddying in the
backlash of a rude current of bucolic unfamiliarity.</p>

<p>Unlike Rucker, the mechanician, who promptly
donned overalls and jumper, pulled his tight-fitting
burglar&#8217;s cap down to his ears, and put
himself at the head of Tregarvon&#8217;s drilling squad
on the mountain top, Merkley took to drink and
the company of the loungers on Tait&#8217;s porch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Here he became (though unhappily without
knowing it) a target for the shrewd wit of the
idlers, and, what he was even further from suspecting,
the gossip circle&#8217;s chief source of information
touching the daily progress of the
latest attempt to make a silk purse out of the
Ocoee sow&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>At first there was little for Merkley to tell, and
the army of leisure, smoking its corn-cob pipes
and whittling the corners of the packing-boxes
on Tait&#8217;s porch, looked on and amused itself by
slyly baiting the disconsolate Londoner.</p>

<p>Day by day, Tregarvon, Carfax, and the promoted
chauffeur turned out early in the morning,
took their places with the native laborers
in the tram-car, and were lifted to the scene of
their labors on high Pisgah. At sunset they
came down, ate much, smoked a little, talked
less, and, save for an occasional evening when
Tregarvon and his guest got out the yellow automobile
and drove to Highmount College, went
early to bed as those who had earned their rest
by good, honest muscle-weariness.</p>

<p>But when the smoke plume streaming bravely
from the stack of the mountain-top drilling plant
announced the actual beginning of the experiment,
Merkley brought news to Tait&#8217;s. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
had gone wrong on the mountain summit;
something was continually going wrong. The
two young men inhabiting the tumble-down
office-building across the railroad-track no longer
went to bed immediately after their evening meal.
Instead, there were prolonged conferences behind
the closed door of the dining-room in the rear.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Rucker, characterized by
Merkley as a despised, greasy-handed mechanic,
whose burglarish aspect would earn him the
attentions of a plain-clothes policeman in any
properly Scotland-Yarded city of the world, was
sometimes called in to these dining-room conferences,
while he, Merkley, once the confidential
and trusted valet of his Grace the Duke of
Marlford, was excluded. At this point in his
narrative, Merkley, being the worse for two or
three tiltings of Jeff Walters&#8217;s or old man Layne&#8217;s
jug of corn whiskey, would become tearful and
despondent.</p>

<p>These Merklean hints of a changed condition
of affairs on Mount Pisgah were well buttressed
by sundry discouraging facts. During the making-ready
of the drilling plant everything had
gone on fairly well. But dating from the hour
when Rucker had first sent live steam whistling
into the cylinder of the small portable engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
which furnished the power, a stream of disaster
had trickled discouragingly and persistently upon
the experiment.</p>

<p>First the drills went dull and refused to cut
the fine-grained sandstone of the plateau; and
when Rucker had retempered them, the engine
worked water and started a cylinder-head. After
the cylinder was repaired, one of the natives
who was firing the boiler let the water get too
low&mdash;to the loosening of some of the boiler-flues,
and to the imminent risk of an explosion.</p>

<p>Rucker, handiest of mechanics, calked an
entire day on the loosened flues, and the machinery
was started again. Two hours later the
pivot-bolt of the big timber walking-beam which
imparted the up-and-down motion to the drill
worked loose, and the walking-beam came down,
one end of it narrowly missing Tregarvon, and
the other wrecking the machinery to the tune of
a hundred dollars and an indefinite interval of
waiting for renewals.</p>

<p>It was after this last and most disheartening
of the disasters, the only one thus far that Rucker
had not been able to repair on the spot, that the
two young men once more shut the door of the
back-office dining-room upon a disappointed London
serving-man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;By George! I&#8217;m beginning to come around
to your view of it, Poictiers,&#8221; said Tregarvon,
cramming his pipe with dry tobacco from the jar
set out by Uncle William. &#8220;These setbacks are
knocking us too regularly to fit decently into
any chapter of accidents. I&#8217;m beginning to believe
they are inspired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is precisely what I have been trying
to tell you and Rucker all along, but neither of
you would have it that way,&#8221; rejoined Carfax
coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, carry your theory to a conclusion;
who&#8217;s doing it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! now you are getting out to a place where
the water is over my head,&#8221; Carfax admitted,
toying delicately with a pipeful of strong
&#8220;natural-leaf&#8221; tobacco. &#8220;According to Captain
Duncan&#8217;s prophecy, you have two possible ill-wishers&mdash;haven&#8217;t
you?&mdash;the C. C. &amp; I. people
and the McNabbs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but it is rather incredible on both
counts, don&#8217;t you think? You can hardly imagine
a great corporation getting down on its hands
and knees to chuck pebbles into the wheels of
our little mechanism up on Pisgah.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax nodded. Then he said: &#8220;How about
the McNabbs?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;It seems rather more in their line, you&#8217;d say.
And yet I haven&#8217;t a shadow of right to accuse
them. So far, they are entirely mythological; a
mere name mentioned by Captain Duncan and
a few others. So far as I am aware, I have not
yet seen a McNabb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever it is who is setting these little traps
for us is deucedly clever,&#8221; remarked Carfax, who
was still toying half-heartedly with his long-stemmed
pipe. &#8220;Rucker is fooled, all right; he
still insists that it is mere hard luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and that is another argument against the
McNabb hypothesis,&#8221; Tregarvon put in. &#8220;It
would take a pretty skilful mechanic to fool
Rucker; and from what I can hear, these title-claimants
are ignorant mountaineers whose mechanical
gifts most probably don&#8217;t rise beyond
the lock action of an old-fashioned squirrel-rifle
or the simple intricacies of a ten-quart whiskey-still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which brings us back to the original proposition&mdash;the
C. C. &amp; I.,&#8221; suggested Carfax reflectively,
and, after a pause: &#8220;How long is this
last smash going to hang us up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three or four days. If Rucker gets back
from Chattanooga with the new gears by Monday,
he will be doing well.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;All right. To-morrow morning I shall ask
you to lend me your yellow chug-wagon. I have
a premonition that the spirit will move me to
go and run this little mystery of yours into a
corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon laughed good-naturedly. &#8220;You&#8217;d
much better go back to your own stamping-ground
and begin to take up your shooting engagements.
You can&#8217;t afford to stay down here
monkeying with this last-resort hustle of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The golden youth was looking shrewdly over
the smoke wreaths at his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a last resort, Vance?&#8221; he asked quietly,
adding: &#8220;You have never told me much about
the family smash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was complete, Poictiers; an up-to-date,
finished product of modern high-finance methods.
The Vanderburg crowd got father against the
wall in the steel merger, and&mdash;well, you&#8217;ll know
how bad it was when I tell you that it killed him.
The doctors said pneumonia, but it was really a
Wall Street sand-bagging. He didn&#8217;t leave a
will; and when we gathered up the fragments
afterward, we knew why he didn&#8217;t; there wasn&#8217;t
enough to make it worth while. So, you see, the
Ocoee <i>is</i> a last resort, for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was musing again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Yet you are going to many a comfortable
little gold mine,&#8221; he said, after a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Byrd&#8217;s Colorado millions?&mdash;yes. And
I am rather sorry; for Elizabeth&#8217;s sake, not less
than for my own. We were engaged before Uncle
Byrd died, and he knew it. It was entirely unnecessary&mdash;not
to say cruel&mdash;for him to leave
his fortune to Elizabeth on the condition that
she shouldn&#8217;t change her mind and marry somebody
else, and to me in case she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax did not comment upon the cruelty.
He was perfectly familiar with the terms of Mr.
Byrd Tregarvon&#8217;s will. Instead, he said: &#8220;You
hear from Elizabeth regularly, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly. Duty is always written out
in large capitals for Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think she writes to you from a sense
of duty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t put it just that way. But I have
no doubt she conceives it to be her duty to a
man she has promised to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t say such things as that, Vance,
not even to me,&#8221; corrected the other man quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I shouldn&#8217;t. It is only one of the
many ways in which Uncle Byrd&#8217;s millions corrode
things. Without meaning to, the old uncle
stood matters upon an entirely different, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
most difficult, footing for us two. We meant to
marry: we had passed our word to the various
members of the clan that we were going to marry;
and the clan was glad because it had always
counted upon that outcome for us. So far as a
man up a tree might discern, it was a perfectly
free choice for both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Carfax, when Tregarvon stopped
to refill his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then one day, out of a clear sky, <i>zip!</i> comes
Uncle Byrd with his will and his millions. After
which, of course, Elizabeth can&#8217;t throw me over
without impoverishing herself; and it is equally
out of the question for me to let her do it. Moreover,
it is imperatively up to me to make good
before I marry her. If I don&#8217;t, uncharitable people
will say that I let go of the business end of
things because I knew that my wife&#8217;s money
would stop all the holes to keep the wind away.
There you have it&mdash;sermon length.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax smoked in sober silence for quite a few
minutes. Then he said mildly: &#8220;Do you know,
Vance, I don&#8217;t more than half like your attitude&mdash;as
you&#8217;ve just expressed it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s smile was a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what there is about it that you don&#8217;t
like, and I&#8217;ll change it, Poictiers. You are by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
long odds the best friend I have in the world, and
I&#8217;d change a dozen attitudes for you, any day in
the week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t lover-like,&#8221; Carfax objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that it is too purely cousinly? I
can&#8217;t very well help that phase of it, you know;
we <i>are</i> cousins, and we have been trotting around
together, more or less, ever since Noah walked out
of the ark. Nothing like that for killing sentiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But sentiment shouldn&#8217;t be killed, if you are
going to marry Elizabeth,&#8221; insisted the purist.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have threshed all that out, time and again,
down to the final spear of straw, Elizabeth and I,&#8221;
Tregarvon explained carelessly. &#8220;At first we did
try to galvanize ourselves into some of the sentimental
throes, but it was such a ridiculous little
comedy that Elizabeth herself called it off. We
are sufficiently fond of each other; Uncle Byrd&#8217;s
will is mandatory, and we shall be able to live
together without quarrelling. What more could
you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Carfax thoughtfully.
&#8220;Your summary fits in pretty accurately with the
way of the world. Yet, if I had to change places
with either of you, I fancy I should ask a good
bit more.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;If you were Elizabeth Wardwell, you wouldn&#8217;t
ask any more; and if you were Vance Tregarvon,
you couldn&#8217;t. So there you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a smoke-beclouded silence, and
into the thick of it Carfax launched a pointed
query:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you told Elizabeth anything at all
about the girls&#8217; school on the mountain&mdash;Highmount?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure; and about the bewitching Miss
Birrell, as well. I always tell Elizabeth everything;
I haven&#8217;t sense enough not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And her comment?&#8221; asked the golden one
half-absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Miss Birrell, you mean? To tell the
brazen truth, I expected a wigging; not anything
like a jealous outbreak, you understand&mdash;Elizabeth
is miles above that&mdash;but some nicely worded,
cool-lipped advice about not pitching the conventions
out at the window just because I happen
to be living a thousand miles from real civilization&mdash;Philadelphia
civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. She didn&#8217;t say a word about
Miss Birrell, specifically, but she wrote me a
good cousinly letter in which she told me how
glad she was that I needn&#8217;t deny myself all of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
social mitigations, and urging me not to let my
job on the Ocoee make a one-sided hermit of me.
That letter came nearer to making me sentimental
over her than anything else she has ever
said or done. It did, for a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax did not vote Aye or No on this. He
appeared content to let the sentimental matter
rest, since he went back to the business difficulties.</p>

<p>&#8220;About this last-resort tussle of yours, Vance,
I see now why it is mighty necessary for you to
make it win, and I wish you had a little better
assurance that you are not up against a brace
game; that Old Pisgah hasn&#8217;t stacked the cards
on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t very well afford to think of that possibility,&#8221;
said Tregarvon grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose you can&#8217;t. Yet if the genially
cynical attitude of the native bystander counts
for anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The loafers over at Tait&#8217;s, you mean? They&#8217;d
scoff at anything that smelled of good, honest
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking of them particularly, though
they help swell the grand total. But the entire
countryside seems to think that you are barking
up an empty tree. President Caswell says you
are wasting time and money; and that mild-eyed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
clerical-looking professor of sciences, Hartridge,
fairly chortled when I told him what we were
doing. You may remember that he strolled over
from Highmount the day we started the drill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; Tregarvon demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He very pointedly said nothing. But there
was a look in his skim-milk eyes that recalled the
villain in a play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was laughing appreciatively. &#8220;You
have an eye for the dramatic possibilities, always,
haven&#8217;t you, Poictiers? Why should Mr. William
Wilberforce Hartridge have it in for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only make a crude guess. Even a mild-eyed
professor of sciences may turn, like the
trodden worm. You umpire him out of the game
pretty ruthlessly when we spend an evening at
Highmount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Miss Richardia? Pshaw! you don&#8217;t
suppose that dried-up old stick of a pedagogue&mdash;why,
it would be Beauty and the Beast!&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s smile was truly angelic, but it betrayed
a wisdom far beyond his years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he rejoined reflectively, &#8220;Hartridge may
be all of ten years your senior&mdash;possibly fifteen.
No doubt he ought to be quietly chloroformed
and carried behind the scenes. But, as I say, he
chortled&mdash;with his eyes&mdash;when I told him that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
you were planning to drill a series of test-holes,
continuing the series until you find the place where
your two coal seams come together as one. He is
a geologist, among other things, and they tell me
he knows this region like a book. I believe I&#8217;d
cultivate him a little, if I were you; even if it did
cost me an occasional <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Miss Richardia
Birrell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon scoffed hardily at the suggestion,
and the scorn was not thrown away upon his companion.
Perhaps that was the reason why Carfax,
going to bed a little later, without the ministrations
of a lachrymose and whiskey-breathing
Merkley, opened the back of his watch to gaze
long and earnestly at a picture therein, closing
the case finally with a little sigh. Millions are
good things in their way, but there be pearls,
trampled thoughtlessly underfoot by the millionless,
which millions cannot buy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br />


<small>Daddy Layne, and Others</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the morning after the crash of the walking-beam
and the consequent halting of the
mountain-top activities, Carfax took the yellow
car out of its warehouse garage; and after driving
for a half-hour or so up and down the valley
road with a tonneauful of speechless but highly
delighted children picked up at Tryon&#8217;s and
Jeff Walters&#8217;s, he pulled up in front of Tait&#8217;s
and went in, ostensibly to buy smoking tobacco,
but really to make friends with the country-store
idlers.</p>

<p>Cursory observers from an alien North, penetrating
now and then to unhackneyed regions in
the Cumberlands or the Great Smokies, are apt
to find the country folk, either valley or mountain
bred, reticent by nature and notably shy of
strangers. But there was no resisting the genial
and childlike affability of the young man who
had been giving the village children joy-rides,
who recklessly bought a box of Tait&#8217;s best two-for-a-nickel
cigars and distributed them generously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
as one among friends, and who presently
had the hood lifted from the yellow car&#8217;s motor
installation and was explaining, in words of one
syllable, the workings of the driving mechanism
to a group of curious and deeply interested onlookers.</p>

<p>The small lecture explanatory gave Carfax a
chance to pick his man, and the choice fell upon
the elder Layne. Would Mr. Layne like to take
a little ride up the road in the car?&mdash;just to see
how much more easily manageable it was than a
horse-drawn vehicle?</p>

<p>Daddy Layne was overwhelmed with embarrassment,
and was also secretly puffed up with
pride, though he did not yield too easily, a disposition
to haggle and make terms being a ruling
passion in the Layne nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low I warn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; none o&#8217; takin&#8217; a trip
this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he mused reflectively. &#8220;Man
ortn&#8217;t to go projeckin&#8217; &#8217;round on his&#8217;n travels
when thar&#8217;s sech a heap o&#8217; work to be done on
the place. But then, thar&#8217;s my married daughter
Malviny&mdash;her man&#8217;s coal-diggin&#8217; for the C. C.
&amp; I., up yander at Whitlow; ef ye could git me
thar an&#8217; back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax assured him that there was nothing
easier, and by dint of holding the big car down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to its slowest speed on the five-mile run to Whitlow
he accomplished his purpose, which was to
beguile Layne into telling him all that the countryside
knew about the C. C. &amp; I., its methods,
its local managers, and whether or not the report
was true that it made industrial war upon the
smaller companies and individual mine owners.</p>

<p>Layne gave him the countryside point of view,
which was, of course, inimical to the corporation&mdash;to
any corporation. The C. C. &amp; I. paid its
men next to nothing for digging the coal and
then sold it for fabulous prices to the people
in the cities; it ran company stores and the
miner who refused to buy his supplies thereat
was likely to find himself out of a job; when a
coal-digger was hurt or killed in an accident, the
company&#8217;s long purse defeated the ends of justice
in the damage suit; and so on to the end of the
accusative category.</p>

<p>Pinned down to the particulars about the
Whitlow, Layne admitted that the young engineer
in charge as superintendent was a &#8220;squar&#8217;&#8221;
man; but Connolly, the local manager under this
superintendent, was, in Layne&#8217;s description, a
man-killer. As to the company&#8217;s policy toward
its competitors, Layne could say nothing definite,
the countryside point of view not being penetrative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of hidden corporation methods. But it
was true that the only mines in operation in the
valley belonged to the C. C. &amp; I. Company.
Others had been opened from time to time, but
they were usually short-lived.</p>

<p>This drawing of Daddy Layne on the drive to
Whitlow, and, later, an interview with Connolly,
a hard-mouthed Irishman whose crass brutality
apparently justified Layne&#8217;s descriptive epithet
of &#8220;the man-killer,&#8221; gave Carfax a clue which
he followed patiently until it was time to take
Layne back to Coalville; a clue which led to a
scraped acquaintance with the local leaders of
the Amalgamated Mine Workers, to affable and
seemingly pointless talks with all who dared to
talk, and finally to a friendly conference with
the miner Dockery, Layne&#8217;s son-in-law.</p>

<p>&#8220;The kindling-wood for your obstruction fire
is all cut and stacked at Whitlow, Vance,&#8221; was
his dinner-table announcement to Tregarvon at
the close of this day of investigation. &#8220;I have
discovered a number of things. First, that the
C. C. &amp; I. methods of benevolent assimilation
as directed toward possible competitors have
varied from instigating all sorts of trouble in
the mines to be squelched up to swallowing them
whole in forced sales of stock.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;That sounds cheerful,&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;Go
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next, they leave it to the local managers to
nip any new venture in the bud as effectually and
quietly as possible, without bothering the trust
headquarters. I took a long chance on Connolly,
the assistant superintendent at Whitlow,
and got that much of it pretty straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that he admitted any
such thing as that to you, when it is known all
up and down the valley that you are interested
here with me!&#8221; exclaimed Tregarvon, wholly
incredulous.</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s smile would have made a blushing
debutante envious.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Mr. Connolly&#8217;s office, I was a lost lamb of
the flock, looking most pathetically for somebody
to lead me home,&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;A fellow
named Tregarvon had got me down here from
New York with a view to pulling my financial
leg as an investor in some coal property a few
miles down the valley&mdash;at Coalville, in fact. I
enlarged somewhat upon this part of it; kept it
up until I was reasonably sure that I had convinced
Connolly that I am a woolly sheep, merely
waiting for somebody to come along with a pair
of sharp shears.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Good&mdash;ripping good!&#8221; Tregarvon chuckled.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve missed your calling, Poictiers, by all
the distance lying between Riverside Drive and
the city detective department down-town. But,
as you say, you took a long chance; unless Connolly
is a bigger fool than he looks to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I? But Connolly is simply an abysmal
brute; a man-driver without any of the little
gifts of perspicacity. He took me under his wing
like a stepfather-in-law; advised me bluntly to
put my money into Consolidated Coal at one-forty
rather than to go gunning on my own hook,
or yours, or anybody&#8217;s, in Consolidated Coal&#8217;s
intimate back yard. Pressed a little harder, he
hinted that you wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to dig any
real coal out of the Ocoee, providing there were
any worth digging&mdash;which there wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t be allowed, Mr. Connolly?&#8217; said
I, as lamb-like as possible. &#8216;How could Tregarvon
be prevented?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s manny a way, Misther Carfax,&#8217; he
scowled up at me; and then he let the cat out
of the pillow-case: &#8216;These young min widout
practical experience&mdash;&#8217;tis manny a blunder they&#8217;ll
be making, and they&#8217;re soon discouraged entirely.
I&#8217;m hearing that this same Misther Tregarvin is
having throuble to beat the band, and him not
fair at the beginning of it yet.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Tregarvon was absently spilling a spoonful of
sugar into his after-dinner coffee&mdash;a sufficient
measure of his interest in Carfax&#8217;s story.</p>

<p>&#8220;From all of which you have argued that there
is a C. C. &amp; I. spy in our camp, haven&#8217;t you,
Poictiers?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the remedy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is to find and fire him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The firing part of it will be easy; but the
finding is a horse of another color. All of my
squad save one or two, I believe, have worked
at odd times for the C. C. &amp; I. Every able-bodied
man in this region digs coal a little now
and then; &#8216;huckleberry miners,&#8217; the regulars call
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll simply have to watch and sift; that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; said Carfax.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve done a good day&#8217;s work, anyway,&#8221;
was Tregarvon&#8217;s summing-up of the amateur
detective&#8217;s report. &#8220;Candidly, I didn&#8217;t
think you had it in you, Poictiers. You don&#8217;t
look it, you know&mdash;to the naked eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The angelic smile came and sat upon the clean-shaven,
womanish face of the golden youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, Vance,&#8221; he drawled lispingly,
&#8220;I believe that is my strong point: not
looking the ready-made, hand-me-down villain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
It is foolishly easy to make people take me for a
harmless, good-natured scrap-bag into which
they can tuck any old thing they don&#8217;t happen
to be needing at the moment. Why, even old
Daddy Layne confided in me. Coming home,
he told me all about the feud of the family of
one of his sons-in-law with the McNabbs. By
the way, that reminds me: did you know that
you have two of the McNabb cousins in your
working gang?&mdash;the fellows who call themselves
Morgan and Sill?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon had not known it; and a new field
of conjecture as to the disasters was promptly
opened. Why charge the coal trust with the
campaign of obstruction when two of the avowed
enemies of Ocoee progress were right on the
ground day by day?</p>

<p>Carfax rather sheepishly confessed that his
brain had not been capacious enough to entertain
two ideas at once. Having fixed upon the
coal trust as the trouble source to be investigated,
he had completely overlooked the McNabb
alternative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do time for it, though,&#8221; he promised.
&#8220;To-morrow will be Saturday; and if you&#8217;ll
lend me the car again, I&#8217;ll find out something
more about those moonshiners in the Pocket.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;Not alone, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; Tregarvon objected
joyously. &#8220;It is going to be my Saturday off,
too&mdash;and a holiday at Highmount. I&#8217;ll go with
you, as far as the college, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the day following Carfax&#8217;s journey of
investigation to Whitlow, Tregarvon did
not keep his promise to accompany the amateur
Vidocq. There were still some repairs to be
made on the tramway, and since a working
squad of the laborers turned up to round out
the week, Tregarvon stayed with his men and
became a track foreman again.</p>

<p>Carfax, too, had apparently changed his mind
overnight. Instead of driving off up the mountain
after breakfast, he headed the yellow car
down the valley road and was gone all day.
When he returned, late in the afternoon, it was
evident that he had discovered some other way
of ascending Pisgah. The committee of leisure,
sitting, as usual, on Tait&#8217;s porch, and amusing
itself, also as usual, at the expense of an expatriated
London serving-man, marked the yellow
car returning by way of the mountain pike;
observed, further, that Carfax was accompanied
by two men, one of whom sprang from the car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
at the turn in the road nearest to the railway
and ran to catch a northbound train of coal-empties,
so escaping unidentified by the idlers.
Carfax&#8217;s other passenger, well-known to Coalville
as &#8220;The Bug Professor&#8221; at Highmount,
descended from the auto more deliberately and
went across to the coke-ovens to shake hands
with Tregarvon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Comp&#8217;ny come, over yander,&#8221; Daddy Layne
remarked to Merkley. &#8220;Better hump yo&#8217;self
acrost the track an&#8217; git ready to curl yo&#8217; boss&#8217;s
ha&#8217;r, hadn&#8217;t ye, English?&#8221;</p>

<p>Merkley adjourned himself accordingly, reaching
the office-building in time to be sent to
show Hartridge the way to the bath-room on the
second floor. Carfax made no explanation to
Tregarvon about the guest-bringing other than
to say that he had captured the professor on the
mountain, and had brought him down to take
pot-luck of Uncle William&#8217;s preparing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can eat him all right,&#8221; said the young
mine owner hospitably; &#8220;but if we have to sleep
him as well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t,&#8221; Carfax asserted. &#8220;I have promised
to drive him back to Highmount in the car
after dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s better. Who was the other fellow?&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
one who jumped out and sprinted for
the up freight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Carfax mysteriously; &#8220;wait and
you&#8217;ll find out.&#8221; And Tregarvon, having no
alternative, had to wait.</p>

<p>The dinner for three in the back-office dining-room
followed in due course, and Tregarvon,
who brought a working-man&#8217;s appetite to the
table, let the other two do most of the talking.
Carfax proved to be at his captivating best; solicitous
for the guest&#8217;s entertainment, ingenuous,
eager to be informed. Wouldn&#8217;t Mr. Hartridge
have some more of the&mdash;er&mdash;rabbit, he thought
it must be? And was it really a fact that the
entire Cumberland region was underlaid by a
vast sheet of bituminous coal?</p>

<p>Tregarvon ate and listened, and presently became
aware of two things: that Carfax was
persistently threshing the talk around to the
coal-measures, and that the professor seemed
equally determined to escape from them. A
little later, he observed that in this verbal ball-passing
Carfax was proving himself the better
player. Hartridge was coerced inch by inch;
first into talking about the Southern coal-fields
in the abstract, and finally into relating the ancient
history of the Ocoee; which was the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
for which Carfax had baited and set the
dinner trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspect Mr. Tregarvon can tell you more
about the history of the Ocoee than I can,&#8221; Hartridge
demurred modestly, after Carfax had fairly
pushed him over the brink; and upon Tregarvon&#8217;s
monosyllabic disclaimer, he went on reflectively:
&#8220;Let me see; I believe it was about
ten years ago that the first company was formed&mdash;to
the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut,
psaltery, and dulcimer, as you might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A promoter&#8217;s scheme?&#8221; queried Carfax,
alertly inquisitive now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A man from New York&mdash;Parker was
his name&mdash;launched the enterprise; bought a
little land, obtained free-will donations of a
great deal more, and, as a favor to the benighted
natives who had contributed the land, consented
to part with about forty-five per cent of the
stock of his company at half-price, payable in
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear; what a world this is!&#8221; sighed
Carfax gently. &#8220;Sold them their own land back
again, did he? And then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge&#8217;s smile was genially cynical.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it took the able Mr. Parker all of
four months, or possibly a little longer, to squeeze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the local stockholders&mdash;the only investors who
had contributed any real values&mdash;out of his
scheme; after which he sold the reorganized
Ocoee to a New England syndicate. The Yankees&mdash;pardon
me; the word is no longer a term
of reproach with us&mdash;the Yankees meant honestly
by the Ocoee; though, of course, they were under
no obligation to recognize the frozen-out natives.
They spent money liberally in development and
on a costly equipment. But it proved to be a
bad investment for them&mdash;as it had for the
natives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; murmured Carfax. &#8220;Now I am better
able to understand President Caswell&#8217;s attitude.
In strict justice, he would say, the mine belongs
to those earliest investors who contributed the
land and bought the stock; or at least these
early people should have an equity in it. These
later&mdash;er&mdash;Yankees had no ethical rights; hence
their venture was bound to be ill-starred. By
Jove, Tregarvon,&#8221;&mdash;and here Carfax&#8217;s lisp became
quite apparent&mdash;&#8220;that puts the black mark
on you, too, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>If Carfax had any diplomatic designs on the
dinner-guest, Tregarvon was not a party to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only know that my father paid good money
for the Ocoee,&#8221; he said bluntly; &#8220;paid it to these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
same Yankees you are telling us about, Mr.
Hartridge, when they were ready to lie down.
It is up to me to prove that they didn&#8217;t stick
him as bad as they doubtless believed they were
sticking him when they pulled him into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax, who was observing the dinner-guest
narrowly, saw the sign he had been watching for
flit into the pale-blue eyes of Mr. William Wilberforce
Hartridge; a half-smile of gratified derision.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think Vance isn&#8217;t very likely to make
good on his little brag, professor?&#8221; he put in,
firing a pointblank shot at the target.</p>

<p>There was no indication that the shot had
gone home, unless it lay in the quick veiling of
the pale-blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I, that I should take out a license
as a prophet of evil, Mr. Carfax?&#8221; was the quiet
rejoinder. &#8220;He is a brave man nowadays who
has the assurance to deny anything whatever
to youth, vigor, and the spirit of modern industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, you believe that Tregarvon isn&#8217;t going
to win out?&#8221; persisted the golden youth.</p>

<p>Hartridge laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Miss Richardia might put it, I haven&#8217;t
any think coming to me, have I?&#8221; he parried.</p>

<p>Carfax gave it up. There was a point beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
which he could not press a man who was dipping
with him into the common salt-dish, and
he felt that the point had been reached.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pity you can&#8217;t stay and spend the
evening with us, Mr. Hartridge,&#8221; he said, a
little further along, when Uncle William came
in to bare the table; but he added nothing to
the conventional protest when the professor declared
that he must go: on the contrary, he
sped the parting guest so nimbly that Tregarvon
was scarcely at his third pipe-filling when
the purring of the yellow car&#8217;s motor announced
Carfax&#8217;s return from Highmount.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so!&#8221; was the New Yorker&#8217;s first
word, as he came in to take his place before the
handful of fire on the dining-room hearth.
&#8220;Where is my pipe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you tell me?&#8221; queried Tregarvon,
finding the pipe and pushing the tobacco within
reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Hartridge knows, or thinks he knows,
that you are on a false scent up yonder on the
Pisgah cliffs: also, that he is deuced glad of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see farther into the millstone than
I can, if you can draw any such conclusion as
that,&#8221; Tregarvon remarked. &#8220;I thought he
bluffed you good and plenty.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;He did; and then again he didn&#8217;t. I insist
that there is something doing, and that this
mild-mannered gentleman who teaches mathematics
and the natural sciences is in on it. I
have just had an experience that was an eye-opener.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unload it,&#8221; said Tregarvon briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody tried to kill one of us a few minutes
ago, and&mdash;and I&#8217;m afraid Hartridge knew
it was due to come off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense&mdash;you&#8217;re joking!&#8221; Tregarvon had
come out of his pipe-musings with a bound.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you just what happened, and then
you shall judge for yourself. You know that
stretch of good road about two-thirds of the
way up the mountain?&mdash;the longest one there
is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just as we turned into it, going up,
Hartridge twisted himself in the seat, looked
back, and made some sort of a motion with his
hand. I was talking; trying to pump him some
more; and I don&#8217;t know why I should have noticed
the bit of pantomime. Neither do I know
why, coming down a few minutes later, I should
have hit that piece of road at a ten-mile-an-hour
gait instead of a thirty or forty. It was mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
lucky I wasn&#8217;t speeding. For about two shakes
of a dead lamb&#8217;s tail you stood to lose a good
friend and a twenty-five-hundred-dollar car.
There was a tree lying across the road at precisely
the correct angle to shoot me out into
space if I had hit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; exclaimed the listener. &#8220;Done
while you were going and coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done while I was going and coming. And
that tree was lying at the exact spot where Hartridge
turned in his seat and made the little signal
with his hand to somebody that I couldn&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, good Lord, Poictiers! It&#8217;s unbelievable.
Why, the man wasn&#8217;t ten minutes away from his
bread-breaking with us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that. You have the facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stopped, skirmished under the tonneau
seat and found your towing rope, and took a
hitch on the obstruction. The car was good for
it, and I dragged the tree around and rolled it
over the embankment. Then I examined the
place where it had stood: it had been partly
undermined by the road grading, and probably
didn&#8217;t require much of a push to tip it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it might have been a sheer accident?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was shaking his head. &#8220;I thought so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
at first. But when I turned the flash-light on the
gap it had left in the upper bank, I saw that it
had not fallen accidentally. There are pick
marks in the clay, and a crowbar had been thrust
in behind the roots to pry with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t see or hear anybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a sign. I even went so far as to make
a circuit in the woods along the upper embankment.
There wasn&#8217;t a leaf stirring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think a minute, Poictiers: whatever
crazy grudge any one might have against me or
the Ocoee, it couldn&#8217;t be made to lap over on
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right; it is your car, and you have
usually driven it. You are doubtless the one
who had the narrow escape, and I was only your
happen-so proxy.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a thoughtful half-hour they sat before the
dying embers of the fire and discussed the murderous
attempt in all its bearings, Tregarvon
stoutly maintaining to the last that Hartridge
could not possibly have been an accomplice. But
disregarding that single slight clue, they were
left completely in the dark as to the identity
or motive of the man or men who had tried to
wreck the car.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the discussion Tregarvon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
had suggested the McNabbs; and after every
other guess had been exhausted he returned to
them. But Carfax demurred at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As I told you yesterday, you
have two of the McNabbs in your working gang,
and they have had a thousand chances to extinguish
you since you came down here. Besides,
I&#8217;ve been over in the Pocket neighborhood to-day,
and have found out a lot about the clan McNabb.
They&#8217;re perfectly harmless, I should say. I ran
across both Morgan and Sill, and they took me
in and fed me fat bacon and corn pone. It is all
of ten miles to their shack in the Pocket, and they
would have had to walk out to get on this side of
Pisgah. Besides that, Wilmerding gave me a lot
of pointers about the McNabb tribe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Wilmerding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the man who rode down the mountain
with Hartridge and me, and made the quick dash
for the up-train. He is the chief of staff for the
C. C. &amp; I. in the Wehatchee Valley; has the oversight
of all the various mines of the company.
He is a fine fellow; a mining engineer with a few
German university finishing touches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you happen to meet him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hunted him up this morning; drove down
to the Cardiff Mine for that purpose. They told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
me yesterday at Whitlow that he was at the
Cardiff. I found him, and we foregathered on the
spot. He is having some labor troubles, and was
about to drive over the mountain to the Swiss
settlement at New Basel to see if he couldn&#8217;t
pick up a little new blood. I didn&#8217;t have to
persuade very hard to get him to abandon his
horse and buckboard, and I drove him over and
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is all right, you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As straight as a string. If the C. C. &amp; I. is
crooked, he is no party to the underhand work.
Also, he told me a lot about the McNabbs. He
seems to be quite certain that they have no grudge
of their own to work off. Laster McNabb, who
is the grandfather of the outfit and the chief of
the clan, has talked very freely with Wilmerding
about the Ocoee lawsuit, and if the McNabbs
have it in for anybody, it is for the lawyer who
dragged them into the fight with the New Englanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon stood up to rest an elbow against
the rough stone mantel. &#8220;If your estimate of
Wilmerding is correct, the C. C. &amp; I. can&#8217;t be
held responsible; and, on the other hand, it
doesn&#8217;t seem to be the mountaineers. Yet we
have had the accidents with the drilling machinery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
and somebody has just tried to assassinate you.
You may say it&#8217;s Hartridge, but I can&#8217;t follow
you there. The motive is lacking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the motive altogether lacking?&#8221; Carfax
queried gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that Hartridge may be asinine
enough to think that I am trespassing on his
preserves at Highmount? That is nonsense.
Miss Richardia Birrell and I are merely good
friends. Besides that, I don&#8217;t believe she has ever
given the &#8216;bug professor&#8217; a second thought, sentimentally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not. But a woman as a factor in any
problem is always the unknown quantity,&#8221; Carfax
remarked half musingly. Then he added: &#8220;It
would be a real charity, both to you and to Professor
William Wilberforce, if some outsider would
step in and marry Miss Richardia out of the game,
don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s frown was morose. Slowly but
surely the light with the difficulties, material and
mysterious, was working a change in the young
man whose chief characteristic had hitherto been
finding its principal expression in the light-hearted
optimism of those who neither toil nor spin. For
the first time in his wealth-smoothed saunter he
was coming to hand-grips with the primitive, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the quick glance shot at Carfax was almost a
challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;d like to be the outsider, Poictiers?
Is that what you had in mind?&#8221; he threw
in bluntly.</p>

<p>Carfax, gazing reflectively into the heart of the
fire embers, took the demand, or assumed to take
it, at its face value.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chap might do a lot worse,&#8221; he replied, as
one who weighs the pros and cons judicially.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a broken family, to be sure, as to its fortunes,
but it&#8217;s good blood. They say that the
old judge is as fine as they make &#8217;em; a gentleman
of the old Southern school, land-poor, but
as proud as Lucifer. The two McNabb boys were
telling me about him to-day. They are squatters
on Birrell land, as their forefathers were before
them, and they&#8217;d fight for the old judge at
the drop of the hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t answered my question,&#8221; said
Tregarvon pointedly.</p>

<p>Carfax rose and stretched his arms over his
head like a man who has put in a full day.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and I&#8217;m not going to answer it to-night.
Later on, if you still insist on needing a guardian
angel, there may be a different story to tell.
Where&#8217;s my candle? I&#8217;m going to bed.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII<br />


<small>The Stubborn Rock</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY the time Rucker returned from Chattanooga
with the repairs for the broken drilling
plant, the Saturday-night attempt to wreck the
yellow car on Carfax&#8217;s run down the mountain
had become a past danger-signal, and was in a
fair way to be overlaid and forgotten in a fresh
upturning of the activities.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the new gears one day
more was needed for their installation; then the
smoke plume began to wave again from the top
of the stack on lofty Pisgah, and the drill resumed
its interrupted jouncings in the sandstone.
In due course, and with no added untoward
happenings to delay the work&mdash;this though the
two McNabbs, identified now and closely watched
by Tregarvon, were still retained in the gang&mdash;the
drill reached the first coal seam, penetrated it,
plunged again into rock, and, a few hours later,
into and through the second and lower coal
layer; net result&mdash;failure.</p>

<p>With the new-found fighting resolution now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
fully aroused, Tregarvon did not waste a minute.
In the intervals afforded by temporary pauses in
the drilling he had found time to select a location
farther back on the plateau for the next trial;
and while the boiler of the portable engine was
still hot from the fire-drawing of failure, the transfer
of the plant was begun.</p>

<p>The second trial was a mere repetition of the
first, save that the layer of rock separating the
two coal seams gained six inches in thickness
for the added distance from the original mine
opening in the cliff face at the head of the tramway.
Wilmerding, the genial young superintendent
of the C. C. &amp; I. subsidiaries was on
the ground when the sand-pump tests of this
second hole were made, and he shook his head
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I oughtn&#8217;t to throw cold water;
it doesn&#8217;t come with very good grace from the
boss in the enemy&#8217;s camp,&#8221; he said deprecatingly.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m mightily afraid you gentlemen are
chasing fireflies. You have two distinct seams,
instead of one that has been split by a horizontal
wedge of the sand-rock, and I believe a careful
analysis of the coal in the two seams will prove it.
Going to move still farther back and try again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the surest thing there is,&#8221; said Tregarvon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
who had already set his men at work striking the
derrick. &#8220;I may be licked, but I&#8217;m too big a fool
to know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; laughed Wilmerding; &#8220;I like your
courage immensely. But while you are tapping
it again, send me some samples and let me analyze
the two veins for you. I have a laboratory up
at Whitlow, and I&#8217;ll be glad to help out to that
extent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an enemy, right, Mr. Wilmerding!&#8221;
said Tregarvon heartily. &#8220;A fighting friend
couldn&#8217;t make a fairer offer than that. But you
will find that the two seams are one and the
same. I made even canny old Captain Duncan
admit that he couldn&#8217;t detect any difference in
the coal taken from the two veins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilmerding nodded. &#8220;The captain is canny,
as you say, though you can hardly prove it by me.
I don&#8217;t know him very well&mdash;haven&#8217;t been down
here long enough. Thaxter knows him from
away back, however, and he has told me a good
bit about the old Scotchman, who has the reputation,
by the way, of being at the top of the
heap as an analytical chemist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thaxter?&#8221; put in Carfax interrogatively.
He had been an attentive listener; his usual attitude
in any three-cornered conference.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;Yes. Don&#8217;t you know Thaxter, my bookkeeper?
Not to know Thaxter is to argue yourself
unknown in the Wehatchee. The rank and
file at Whitlow think I&#8217;m the boss, and that
Connolly comes next. But Thaxter is the real
power behind the throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax made the necessary effort of memory
and recalled a pursy little man, round-faced,
gray-haired and genial, who had beamed up at
him through a pair of thick-lensed spectacles on
the day when he had invaded the C. C. &amp; I.
stronghold at Whitlow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember him,&#8221; he told Wilmerding. &#8220;Reminded
me of one of the Brothers Cheeryble,
and I caught myself unconsciously looking about
for the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not having read Dickens, Wilmerding lost the
point of the comparison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Thaxter is It, all right
enough. More than anybody else in this neck
of woods he is Consolidated Coal: has every
coal detail of this entire region down in black
on white, neatly docketed and labelled and
put away for future reference. I carry him on
my pay-roll, but I couldn&#8217;t any more fire him
than I could fire the President of the United
States. On the other hand, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
if he could have my head any minute he
chose to hold up his finger to the big guns in
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice kind of a bombshell to be rolling around
under a man&#8217;s feet,&#8221; Carfax commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Thaxter is harmless; he doesn&#8217;t explode.
He is like the assistant secretaries of the Departments
in Washington, you know; the fellows
who really have the run of the business and
stay on the job while the political chiefs come
and go. They are like the cat: harmless and
necessary and full of wisdom. Which reminds
me: I&#8217;ll bet my wind-broken old nag, here,
against your gas-car, Tregarvon, that Thaxter has
an analysis of these coals of yours filed away
somewhere this very minute. If he has, I&#8217;ll get
it for you. It will be a lot more conclusive than
any I could make, offhand, in my laboratory.&#8221;</p>

<p>So offering, Wilmerding betook himself and his
promise to the road leading to Whitlow, leaving
the two undismayed coal prospectors on
high Pisgah patiently removing their testing
plant to a point still farther back from the cliff
face. By this time the working gang had acquired
the practice which makes perfect; and
before the news of the failure of the second attempt
had spread beyond the comment of Tait&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
store the drill was churning away in the third of
the testing holes, with the lean, bristly-bearded
Sawyer acting as drill-master&mdash;a post which he
had claimed and filled from the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how much other people may laugh
at you; <i>I</i> think your perseverance is beyond
praise,&#8221; said Miss Richardia, on an afternoon
when Tregarvon, scamping his job and snatching
a few moments for himself, had driven her and a
group of the Highmount young women over in
the yellow car to the new location. &#8220;I am sure
you deserve to succeed&mdash;if perseverance by itself
ever deserves anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say, &#8216;by itself&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean sheer, dogged persistence, without
any of the justifying reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the reasons; I&#8217;m obliged to succeed,&#8221;
was the answer rather gloomily given. Carfax
had taken the tonneau party around to the
derrick, and the two in the driving-seat of the
car had their bit of the mountain-top world
momentarily to themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that as if you were sorry,&#8221; laughed
the music teacher. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to succeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To want is to desire and need,&#8221; he explained
meticulously. &#8220;Heaven knows, I need success;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
need it awfully. Yet the very reason for needing
it is vicarious on one hand, and an exhibition of
the meanest sort of purse-pride on the other.
But you know all about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Truly, Miss Richardia did know. It was during
his third evening visit to Highmount, while
Carfax was trundling the entire school in batches
up and down the cherted pike in front of the
college grounds in the auto, and Miss Richardia
had been playing to him in the otherwise deserted
music-room, that Tregarvon had told her
all about the family fortunes, and Elizabeth, and
his engagement, and the Uncle Byrd millions.
He did not regard it as a breach of confidence at
the time; of Elizabeth&#8217;s confidence or his own.
He had merely yielded to an attack of a purely
masculine desire to tell all he knew to the nearest
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;You still think it is necessary to keep Miss
Wardwell waiting?&#8221; Miss Richardia was always
able to answer his unspoken thought without
apparent effort, as he had already learned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have me do anything else,
would you?&#8221; he retorted discontentedly. &#8220;Put
yourself in Elizabeth&#8217;s place: what would you
think of me if I should take advantage of your
good-nature, and so give everybody a chance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
say that I didn&#8217;t need to be in love with you&mdash;that
your money was a sufficient bait?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Birrell was not at all past blushing, and
she did it very prettily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so boyishly personal!&#8221; she laughed,
and the fact that she did not resent the personality
was an ample measure of the degree to which
their intimacy had progressed. And then: &#8220;You
promised me that you were going to be sensible
and straightforward, and all those things. You
said you were going to be entirely frank with
Eliz&mdash;with Miss Wardwell, telling her that you
haven&#8217;t insisted upon her naming the day because
you think you ought to have means of
your own, first. Have you done this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t&mdash;not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you? You owe it to her, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps; but I owe something to myself, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Richardia seized upon the admission
swiftly and turned it as a weapon against him.
&#8220;You do, indeed! You owe it to Mr. Vance
Tregarvon not to keep any of the anchors in
reserve. As you once said, yourself, you are too
impressionable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A light o&#8217; love,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;I must tell
Elizabeth what an eloquent special pleader she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
has unconsciously acquired down here in the wilds
of Tennessee. What have I done that I ought
not to have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not your conscience,&#8221; was the cool-voiced
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are,&#8221; he retorted accusingly. &#8220;You
tell me what I ought to do, and I promise to go
and do it. My intentions are always good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure of even that much, now. You
have changed very remarkably in the past few
weeks, and you must forgive me if I say that the
change hasn&#8217;t been altogether for the better.
You were just a nice, cheerful boy when you
came to Tennessee, and you&#8217;re not that any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have good reasons, and plenty of them,&#8221;
he blurted out. &#8220;Do you want to hear them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when you talk that way,&#8221; said Miss
Birrell, and her attitude became suddenly indifferent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall hear them, whether you want to
or not,&#8221; he broke in almost roughly. &#8220;I have
the whole world against me on this Ocoee proposition;
I have given my word to Elizabeth when
I don&#8217;t love her as the man who is going to marry
her ought to love her; and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite enough,&#8221; she interposed quietly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
&#8220;It only proves what I said a minute ago. You
can&#8217;t afford to hold any of your anchors in reserve.
I think we had better join Mr. Carfax
and the young women. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. And I call that downright cruel, when
we see so little of each other, and I almost never
have you to myself any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your saying such things as that that
makes me think I ought to be cruel. There are
times when you need cruelty. Nothing milder
would do any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may as well say the remainder of it,&#8221;
he prompted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall. It is really serious. You must come
to a better understanding with Miss Wardwell;
and you must stop coming so often to Highmount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first time I went to Highmount you told
me that I might come as often as I pleased. You
needn&#8217;t worry about the school-girls. If you say
the word, I&#8217;ll never speak to one of them again
unless she is duly chaperoned at the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were speaking of Miss Wardwell,&#8221; was
the rather chilling reminder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we will speak of her, then. She isn&#8217;t losing
any sleep on my account. If you only knew
Elizabeth as well as I do&mdash;but what&#8217;s the use!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;There appears to be no use at all, and I have
already said more than your nearest friend ought
to say. Suppose we talk of something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon refused flatly to accept the invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I want to know about my welcome at
Highmount. I have had Mrs. Caswell&#8217;s warrant
in the past. I have it yet. You can&#8217;t make me
stay away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Richardia&#8217;s pretty chin went up a quarter
of an inch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will compel me to be disagreeable;
and I don&#8217;t like to be that. I always have plenty
of work to do in the evenings; quite a number
of the young women would like to take extra
music lessons, and I have a piano in my rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon gasped. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that
you&#8217;d be hard-hearted enough to shut yourself
up? to refuse to see me? That would be&mdash;but
I simply can&#8217;t contemplate it. You&mdash;you don&#8217;t
know what your confidence and your clear insight
have come to mean to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, it is because I do know, or
rather because I know how you are justifying
yourself, that you must&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall not! It is just a frank, open
friendship that has grown very precious to me,
Richardia. Put it upon the lowest possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
grounds; say that it amuses you and doesn&#8217;t
hurt Elizabeth&mdash;I could show you letters from
her in which she actually encourages it&mdash;and
add to these that it does me a whole lot of good.
Why should you freeze up right in the midst of
it, just when I am needing all the encouragement
I can get?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Birrell did not wish to laugh, but his
protest, the shocked pleading of a little boy who
fears he is about to be deprived of his customary
piece of bread and butter with sugar on it, was
too much for her self-control. None the less, she
would not yield a hair&#8217;s-breadth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t convince me, and you needn&#8217;t try,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;Granting what you say&mdash;that it
amuses me and doesn&#8217;t hurt any one else&mdash;there
are still the conventions to be considered. Perhaps
you think, because you are a thousand miles
from Philadelphia, that there are no conventions.
If you do, you are greatly mistaken. Highmount,
for example, has a complete equipment of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound the conventions!&#8221; growled Tregarvon.
Carfax was leading his following back
to the car, and the end of the confidential talk
was approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you needn&#8217;t swear at them,&#8221; said Miss
Richardia, with honey in her tone. &#8220;More than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
that, you would be the last person in the world to
want to have them confounded. In your proper
environment, I can picture you as an exceedingly
correct person; one who would protest most vigorously
if his sister should&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not finish, because the others were
within hearing distance; but the sentence was
sufficiently complete to point the comparison for
Tregarvon. He bent over the steering-wheel and
pretended to be trying the connections of the
substitute battery coil. The feint permitted him
to say in low tones: &#8220;You are altogether right&mdash;as
you always are. I&#8217;ll be as decent as I can:
and it will cost more than you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>After which he descended from the driving-seat
and shifted the responsibility of the return of
the party to Highmount over to Carfax, saying
that since the drill was doubtless nearing the
coal depth, he would better stay on the job.</p>

<p>He was late getting down the mountain that
evening, having worked his crew overtime to settle
a disputed point with Rucker. The dispute,
or rather its outcome, was sufficiently explained
in his announcement to Carfax when he tramped
into the office dining-room and dropped wearily
into a chair before the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;One more slap in the face, Poictiers. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
found the coal about two hours ago, and a little
later the drill landed upon the sandstone layer
again. I&#8217;m too tired to know whether it&#8217;s discouragement
or just plain leg-weariness and back-ache,
but I feel as if something had gone out of
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax rose to the occasion with his customary
cheerful alacrity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to say die, yet a while, Vance,
old man. It merely means another try. If you
are running low in the ammunition-chest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t that; it isn&#8217;t costing so terribly
much. But to tell the blank truth, I don&#8217;t know
where to go with the drill for another try. We
are a good quarter of a mile back from the tramway
head now; an almost impracticable distance,
even if we had found the big vein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is the matter with swinging
around the circle a bit? You have latitude as
well as longitude, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Carfax
the comforter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; there is Ocoee land enough. And
I guess that is about the last hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way had you thought of moving, north
or south?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whichever way you say,&#8221; was the spiritless
reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Carfax took a coin from his pocket and balanced
it upon his thumb. &#8220;Heads, Highmount
way; tails, toward Whitlow,&#8221; he called, and
flipped the coin.</p>

<p>It fell heads uppermost, deciding for the Highmount
direction; and when Tregarvon would
have picked the coin up to return it, Carfax
stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it alone; I&#8217;m superstitious to-night.
Uncle William will be in with your warmed-over
dinner in a minute: let him pick it up and keep
it&mdash;for good luck.&#8221; And a little while afterward,
when the old negro shuffled in with the covered
tray: &#8220;There is a dollar on the floor which we
are both afraid to touch, Uncle William. Don&#8217;t
you want it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man scraped a foot and said: &#8220;Sarvent,
suh,&#8221; but he arranged the table to the
final nicety before going around to look at the
money on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Marsteh Poictiers, whut-all is de marter
wid dat dollah?&#8221; he asked, bending, hands on
knees, to eye it suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing the matter with the dollar,
uncle; the trouble is with us. We are afraid of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sho&#8217; now! Is you? Dat look lak a mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
rightchus dollah to me. Dat ain&#8217;t no debbil&#8217;s
money, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to settle that for yourself. Since
the dollar came out of my pocket a few minutes
ago, I shall be justified in refusing to answer so
personal a question as that relating to its righteousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Hyuh! hyuh!</i> It comed out of yo&#8217; pocket,
an&#8217; yit you is skeered of it? Dat look mighty
cur&#8217;is to me. Look lak you-all is tryin&#8217; to play
trick on de ol&#8217; man, Marsteh Poictiers. I ain&#8217;t
seed no white folks&#8217; money yit dat I&#8217;s skeered
of,&#8221; and he bent cautiously to pick it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Uncle William; it might burn you!&#8221;
said Carfax suddenly; and quite as suddenly the
old negro dropped the coin and started back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless gresshus! but dat <i>wuz</i> hot!&#8221; he exclaimed,
blowing upon his fingers. And then:
&#8220;Des you keep yo&#8217; eye on dat dollah, ef you
please, suh, twell I come back, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll fix &#8217;im,&#8221;
and a little later he returned from the cook-house
with a small tin pan which he turned
down over the piece of money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef dat won&#8217;t be in you gemmans&#8217; way, an&#8217;
you-all &#8217;ll des leab &#8217;im dah, I gwine come back
bimeby an&#8217; tek de cunjer off &#8217;im. I ain&#8217; gwine
lef de ol&#8217; debbil hab dat dollah, not ef it <i>is</i> his&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The little diversion did for Tregarvon what
Carfax had hoped it might; and after the belated
meal was eaten and the pipes were lighted,
the atmosphere of disheartenment was changed
somewhat for the better.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing we have to be thankful
for,&#8221; the disappointed one volunteered, when
his reflections began to mellow in the tobacco
smoke. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t heard from the enemy
since the attempt was made to ditch the car,
and there haven&#8217;t been any more of the unaccountable
accidents to the machinery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; said Carfax. &#8220;And I have been
trying to guess, all along, why he&mdash;or they&mdash;stopped
so abruptly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any good reason why he&mdash;or
they&mdash;should have begun,&#8221; said Tregarvon musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody evidently thought there was a
reason, and afterward changed his mind. Why
should he change his mind? That is the question
that has been puzzling me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he has found out what a good fellow
I really am, and is no longer bloodthirsty,&#8221; put
in Tregarvon, who was too tired to make any
very heavy drafts upon his mentality.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any notion that the fight, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
there is one, is personal to you, have you?&mdash;excluding
Professor Hartridge, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I was only joking. And we&#8217;ll always
exclude Hartridge, if you please; I&#8217;m still
refusing to believe it of him. It was probably
somebody&#8217;s intention to drown the blind kitten
of an Ocoee before it had time to get its eyes
open; but the somebody couldn&#8217;t, by any stretch
of imagination, be Hartridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why has the somebody&mdash;who isn&#8217;t Hartridge&mdash;called
the fight off so suddenly? By
Jove, Vance&mdash;I have an idea! It has dawned
upon the enemy, whoever he is, that it wasn&#8217;t
worth while to efface us at a time when we were
perseveringly going the right way about it to
efface ourselves! I&#8217;d like to make a bet with
you: when we begin drilling in the right place&mdash;if
there is any right place&mdash;the trouble will blossom
out again. What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a thought left that isn&#8217;t too leg-weary
to keep up with you,&#8221; Tregarvon confessed;
whereat he fell to talking of Miss Richardia Birrell,
dribbling on until Carfax, groaning in spirit,
got up to light the bed-room candles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX<br />


<small>A Bad Night for Rucker</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the drilling plant had been moved to
the chance-chosen, fourth trial site a short
half-mile south of the original line of prospect
holes, the work of reinstallation was begun. At
its completion, it was at Rucker&#8217;s suggestion that
the small tool-house was fitted with a single-sashed
window and a folding cot-bed, and that
the duties of night-watchman were added to his
daytime oversight of the drilling machinery.</p>

<p>Just why the plant, which had been left unguarded
since the first week of the campaign,
and had been unmolested, should now need a
night-watchman, the mechanician did not attempt
to explain. His reasons for wishing to
transfer his lodgings from the valley to the
mountain top were entirely personal. He had
been taken as a boarder at the Tryons&#8217;, and to
wear out the dull evenings after working hours,
he had been drawn first into the lounging circle
at Tait&#8217;s store, and later into the smaller circle
of the Layne household on the lower valley road.</p>

<p>The loadstone at Layne&#8217;s was a granddaughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of the patriarch&#8217;s, a black-eyed, red-lipped girl
of primal passions and impulses; and in the beginning
Rucker had been given a fair field and
no questions asked as to his eligible state and
standing. Evening strolls on the country roads
with Nancy Layne for a companion were not to
be compared with a night off on Broadway under
the bright lights; but such diversions were made
to suffice until a day when Daddy Layne, abruptly
pointing to the long-barrelled squirrel-rifle resting
on its pegs over the kitchen fireplace, assumed
the aggressive. &#8220;Git yo&#8217; license an&#8217; yo&#8217;
preachuh, &#8217;r let Nan alone an&#8217; quit projec&#8217;in&#8217;
round this yer valley o&#8217; nights,&#8221; was the old
man&#8217;s ultimatum; and Rucker, having a wholesome
fear of consequences, and the best of reasons
for not applying for a marriage license,
asked permission to sleep at the drilling plant.</p>

<p>The first night on the mountain was frankly
harrowing to the city-bred mechanic, whose burglarish
aspect did not insure him against the still
alarms of the forest intensified by moon-flung
shadows of solemn trees, by scurryings of fallen
leaves rattling like dry bones under the autumn
night-wind, and, more than all, by a sense of complete
and lonely isolation.</p>

<p>Each unfamiliar sound brought Rucker out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
his cot-bed blankets with a bound and sent him
groping to the square window. First it was a
little screech-owl, perching on the walking-beam
of the drill, and chattering out its blood-curdling
cry. Next it was a slow and measured crashing
in the undergrowth, sound mysterious and unnerving
to a degree until the night-prowling cow
responsible for it lowed gently and crossed the
clearing to snuff suspiciously at the boiler and
machinery.</p>

<p>The tension once more relieved, Rucker tumbled
into the blankets again, calling himself shop
names and swearing by all the gods of the metalworkers
that nothing short of a forest-fire or an
earthquake should make him lose any more sleep.
Yet, while he was still only eye-deep in his first
doze a new alarm brought him leaping to his feet
and sent him, blinking and breathing hard, to
the square of moonlight framed by the small window.</p>

<p>What he heard this time sounded like the
measured hoof-beats of a horse. Rucker had a
pocket flash-light, and he turned it upon the face
of his watch. He had gone early to bed, and it
was still early, barely ten o&#8217;clock. A by-road,
the one by which the drilling plant had been
brought in, ran through the wood a little distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
to the left of the glade. Staring wide-eyed,
Rucker made out the shadowy bulk of a wheeled
vehicle standing in this road, with a white horse,
seemingly of incredible size, looming gigantic between
the thills.</p>

<p>The mechanician got his breath, and his heart
began to pump in steadier rhythm. A horse and
buggy betokened the presence of humankind, and
Rucker was not a coward of men. Moreover,
the ball-peen machinist&#8217;s hammer, lying within
easy reach, was no mean weapon of defense in
the grasp of a man who knew how to swing it.</p>

<p>Obsessed by the idea that he might shortly
have to resort to the hammer, the mechanician
was wholly unprepared for what followed. Slowly,
and as if they were materializing out of the
shadows of the wood, two figures glided into the
watcher&#8217;s field of vision: a man, tall, stately,
wearing the long coat and the wide-brimmed soft
hat which even an unobservant Rucker knew to
be the garmentings of the old-fashioned Southern
gentleman. And, hanging on the man&#8217;s arm, a
woman, small and trimly clad.</p>

<p>They came only to the edge of the open glade.
The woman&#8217;s hat left her face in shadow, so
that even if the light had been better, Rucker
could not have seen what she looked like. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
man&#8217;s back was turned to him, and here, again,
he was at fault. Nevertheless, he was presently
able to postulate the man&#8217;s gestures as those of
anger, and to understand that the woman was
pleading with him. It was etched out wholly in
pantomime; Rucker could hear nothing. Twice
or thrice the man made an inclusive motion with
his free hand as if indicating the glade as the
subject of whatever he was saying; and finally
he balled his hand into a fist and shook it wrathfully
at the unoffending drill derrick.</p>

<p>This went on for some moments, the woman,
Rucker fancied, trying to end it and draw the
man away. Whether as the result of her efforts,
or for some other reason, the scene ended as
abruptly as it had begun. The two figures turned
and faded into the wood shadows as mysteriously
as they had come out of them; and while Rucker
was still straining his eyes to keep them in sight,
the horse and buggy vanished to a soft thudding
of hoofs on the sandy road.</p>

<p>After this apparition had disappeared, the
machinist filled his black cutty pipe, opened the
door of the tool-house, and sat upon the step to
smoke and ruminate and strive for a better collecting
of things into their normal groupings.
Later, he strolled out to the by-road to see if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
hoof and wheel marks were really there; to satisfy
himself beyond question that he had not been
dreaming. The ocular demonstration convinced
him that he was sane, sober, and awake. The
hoof-prints were there, though they were by no
means so gigantic as he had expected to find them;
and so were the wheel ruts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I needn&#8217;t be botherin&#8217; my head about
who they was,&#8221; he muttered to himself as he
went back to his seat on the tool-house door-step.
&#8220;Th&#8217; bosses&#8217;ll know that, all right, all
right. But if there&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a whole lot of
this ghost business up here, it&#8217;s me for the downstairs,
even if I do have to duck every time I see
old man Layne comin&#8217; up th&#8217; road. These moonlight
picture-shows get next to my gizzard-nerve.
I ain&#8217;t no ghost-killer&mdash;not me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His pipe was smoked out and, knocking the ash
from the bowl, he got up, having fresh designs
upon the tool-house bed-room and the blanketed
cot. But he was scarcely afoot before the sounds
of wheels and hoofs came again, this time from
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;My gosh!&#8221; he complained, &#8220;are they comin&#8217;
back? Or is it a torchlight procession of &#8217;em?
No, by jing! it&#8217;s somebody else: that horse is a
black one!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>More to be out of harm&#8217;s way than for any spying
purpose, he slipped into the tool-house and
softly closed and fastened the door. When he
tiptoed to the window two other figures had entered
the glade; two men, and both of them with
burdens.</p>

<p>Their movements were even more mysterious
than those of the earlier visitors. The shorter of
the two carried a square box, handling it by a
buckled strap which encircled it, and the other
had a shoulder load which Rucker could liken
only to a small bundle of poles. Both burdens
were quickly put down; and at Rucker&#8217;s final
glimpse, obtained just as the moon was passing
behind a cloud, the shorter man had gone down
on his knees beside the box, and was apparently
opening it.</p>

<p>Everything turned to a blurred gray for the
watcher at the square window while the cloud
obscured the direct rays of the moon; and when
a better light came, the taller of the two men had
disappeared, and the other was standing motionless
under a great oak, whose spreading branches
were sadly obstructing Rucker&#8217;s line of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what the devil is he doin&#8217;?&#8221; was Rucker&#8217;s
demand, whispered to the inner darknesses.
&#8220;And where has t&#8217; other guy skipped to, all of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
sudden. By jinks! I b&#8217;lieve the short one&#8217;s
sightin&#8217; a gun; no, it ain&#8217;t a gun, either; it&#8217;s a
kodak. No, I&#8217;m off again, and I hain&#8217;t got any
more guesses. Now, what t&#8217; &#8217;ell&#8217;s the sawed-off
doin&#8217;, wavin&#8217; his arms up and down that way?
By gollies, this whole mountain&#8217;s gone bug-house,
&#8217;r else I have!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rucker watched the arm-waving for a full
minute before it dawned upon him that the short
man who seemed to be sighting something was
making signals. The small square window of
espial commanded nothing but the glade. The
watcher crept cautiously to the end of the room
facing toward the near-by brow of the mountain.
The moonlight helped him to find the knot-hole
he was looking for, but for a time the contracted
field of vision revealed nothing but a forest tangle
of moon-spattered shadows.</p>

<p>Rucker had the patience of his craft, and the
practical reasoning power that goes with it.
The man under the oak was evidently signalling
to some one to the eastward of his position at the
edge of the glade: Rucker&#8217;s knot-hole in the planking
at the end of the tool-house covered the same
field: hence the eye at the knot-hole should be
able to descry what was apparently visible to
the eyes under the spreading oak.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>The mechanician stuck to his hypothesis until
finally the fact proved it to be the true one.
Far down among the trees, almost at the cliff&#8217;s
edge, Rucker thought, a dancing light, such as
might be made by a flaring pine torch, flashed
up, flickered, and disappeared. The general
aspect of the mystery remained as impenetrable
as before, but one point became clear. The man
under the tree was waving to the man with the
torch, and some purpose, quite well understood
by both, was getting itself forwarded.</p>

<p>Rucker stayed at his peep-hole until the torch
reappeared, flared steadily in one place for a
few seconds, and then went out as suddenly as
if a gust of wind had extinguished it. After which
he tiptoed back to his window, and was there,
looking on curiously, when the torch-bearer came
tramping up from the eastward. There was a
little delay when the upcomer joined the man
under the oak. The watcher saw them taking
the sighting mechanism, whatever it might be,
apart and depositing some portion of it carefully
in the square box; saw the two men resume
their respective burdens and thread their way
rapidly among the trees to the waiting vehicle.
Then came the grinding protest of buggy wheels
cramped short to turn in the narrow by-road,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the <i>shough</i> of a horse, minishing hoof-beats, and
silence.</p>

<p>By this time Rucker was beginning to stand
somewhat less in awe of a forest wilderness which
seemed, after all, to be anything but an uninhabited
solitude. A fresh filling of the short
black pipe was the preliminary to a careful scrutiny
of the ground under the spreading oak-tree.
There was but a thin layer of sandy top-soil
overlying the rock through which the drill was
to be churned on the morrow, but it sufficed to
reveal what Rucker was looking for&mdash;three conical
indentations made by the sharply pointed ends
of a tripod, the stand of the sighting mechanism,
level, transit, or telescope, used by the shorter
of the two men.</p>

<p>This much proved, Rucker went back to the
tool shanty, found and lighted a lantern, and
with it steered a course between the trees to the
eastward point where the torch-bearer had stood.
It took him several minutes to discover the exact
spot; but when it was found and identified
by the remains of the extinguished pine-knot
torch, he whittled a small stake and with a stone
for a hammer drove it to mark the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, by heck!&#8221; he said, when he was once
more sitting on the tool-house door-step to finish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
his pipe. &#8220;If I hain&#8217;t got funny business enough
to keep the bosses guessin&#8217; f&#8217;r a week &#8217;r so, I&#8217;ll
sit up a few minutes longer and pull down some
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was far past midnight when he found himself
nodding over the smoking lantern, and got
up to go and tumble sleepily into his bed. And
this time neither the shrilling of the katydids
and tree-toads nor the screeching of the little
owl that came once more to perch upon the drill
walking-beam, kept him awake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X<br />


<small>Blind Alleys</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was a council of war, held without
preliminaries, to follow Rucker&#8217;s report
made to his two employers on the morning after
the night of mysterious alarms. The small tool
shanty served as the council-chamber, and the
councillors were only two, Rucker having been
heard and dismissed to take his place as chief
mechanician in the drilling squad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk about fourteen-fifteen puzzles and the
fourth dimension: this masquerade puts the
kibosh on them all,&#8221; remarked Carfax, opening
his pocket-case of freshly imported cigarettes.
&#8220;Or are you wiping the slate clean by charging
Billy Rucker with a bad supper or a drink or so
too many?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too circumstantial to be a nightmare.
Besides, there are the two sets of wheel tracks
in the road, and the marks of the tripod under
the oak; likewise the burnt pine torch and
Rucker&#8217;s stake to mark the place of it. It&#8217;s no
pipe-dream&mdash;more&#8217;s the pity.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Then what the deuce is it?&mdash;or they?&mdash;since
there seem to have been two distinct sets of
phenomena.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the owner of the Ocoee shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we may safely assume that Rucker
saw two acts in the same play. But what the
play may have been is beyond my wildest guess.
Rucker&#8217;s suggestion that we&#8217;ve dropped down
into a neighborhood of crazy people seems to
fit better than anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was sitting on the cot with his hands
locked over one knee. &#8220;It is rather pointedly
our job to chase the shy guess into a corner,
don&#8217;t you think? There is mischief in it. One&#8217;s
bosom friends would hardly come here at night
to shake their fists at things, or to run surveyors&#8217;
lines by moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon got up to tramp the floor, but
there was no room in the cluttered tool shanty
and he sat down again upon a coil of rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn this crazy Southern mining country!&#8221;
he rapped out. &#8220;Rucker is right: I believe
it&#8217;s peopled with escaped lunatics fresh
from Bedlam! You&#8217;ve got a theory, Poictiers;
I can see it in your eye. Put it in words. Whom
do you suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Small minds suspect: larger ones reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
calmly,&#8221; said the golden youth in mild irony.
&#8220;The thing for us to do first is to establish a few
identities, if we can. Who were these late-in-the-evening
visitors? Let&#8217;s take them in their
natural order; first come, first served. Rucker
seems to have had a fair eye-shot at the man in
a soft hat and long-tailed coat. Doesn&#8217;t his description
of the man&#8217;s clothes and figure throw
at least a suggestion into you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon frowned. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got Hartridge
on the brain,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;You can travel
anywhere in the South and still find plenty of
men who wear soft hats and full-skirted Prince
Alberts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; quite so. But we have met only one
on Mount Pisgah, thus far, and his name is William
Wilberforce Hartridge. And if we take Mr.
Hartridge for the fist-shaking gentleman, the next
step&mdash;the identity of the lady&mdash;is simplified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it,&#8221; Tregarvon objected sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you won&#8217;t see it. What woman,
from Highmount, would be most likely to be Mr.
Hartridge&#8217;s companion on a moonlight evening
drive? Don&#8217;t let your prejudices, or rather your
prepossessions, make a blind mule of you,
Vance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you mean that the woman was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Richardia Birrell. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily follow,
and I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so dreadfully hard to believe. There
is no reason why she shouldn&#8217;t go driving with
the professor of mathematics, if she feels like
it. Neither is there anything especially culpable
in the fact that she walked down here with him
when he came to shake his professorial fist at
your drilling-machine. When you have cooled
down sufficiently, we&#8217;ll go and see if my little
primary guess won&#8217;t prove out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cool enough,&#8221; was the answer to this;
and together they went to seek the proof.</p>

<p>The buggy tracks in the damp sand of the
little-used road were not hard to trace, and there
were places where the hoof-prints of the horse
which had been driven toward Highmount were
clean-cut and distinct. Carfax was a spoiled
son of fortune only in his affectations. Beneath
the carefully cultivated fopperies there was a
keen, active mentality which rarely missed its
mark and never fumbled. He made pencil
sketches of the hoof-prints on the back of an old
letter in passing, and it was he, and not Tregarvon,
who noted the single peculiarity in the
horse&#8217;s shoeing; a missing corner from the toe-calk
on the left hind foot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>As the New Yorker&#8217;s hypothesis had assumed,
the buggy tracks led directly to Highmount; or
at least the assumption seemed a fair one. The
two investigators did not follow the vehicle trail
all the way to the college gates; could not, since
the trail-recording wood road came out into the
hard-metalled mountain pike a few hundred yards
below the Highmount grounds, and the wheel
marks were no longer visible. But there seemed
to be no reasonable doubt of the correctness of
Carfax&#8217;s guess; and Tregarvon admitted as much
on the way back to the starting-point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you, I&#8217;m not admitting that Richardia
was a party to anything underhanded or crooked,&#8221;
he added in qualification. &#8220;She may have been
driving with Hartridge; as you say, there isn&#8217;t
any particular reason why she shouldn&#8217;t go buggy-riding
with him if she wishes to; and she may
have walked down to the glade with him. I
don&#8217;t say that she didn&#8217;t; but I do say that she
isn&#8217;t tangled up in any of the disreputable mysteries,
knowingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I&#8217;d be as loath to admit that as you
are,&#8221; said Carfax gently. &#8220;In fact, it is barely
possible that I have the better right to defend
her. We&#8217;ll put it all up to Hartridge. The next
thing is to find out, if we can, where Hartridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
got his two surveyors on such short notice, and
what it was that could be proved or disproved
by a transit sight taken in the moonlight under
conditions which must have barred anything like
mathematical accuracy. Where are your blue-prints
of the Ocoee property?&mdash;down below, or
up here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The map copies were in the tool-house, one
set of them; and when they were found, Carfax
spread them out on the cot and pored over them
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not trespassing on somebody else&#8217;s
land, at all events,&#8221; was the verdict, rendered
after he had verified the position of the glade in
which the fourth test-hole was being driven. &#8220;It
is all Ocoee in every direction; your land covers
all this part of the mountain. By the way, what
is this name, &#8216;Westwood,&#8217; written across these
mountain-top plats?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon did not know, and he said so; adding
that he supposed it might be the name of
the original owner of the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he? Ever hear of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall that I have. But that is not
singular. I haven&#8217;t had occasion, or the time,
to dig very deeply into ancient history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
illuminating about these blue-prints, save that
they establish your perfect right to bore holes
almost anywhere you please,&#8221; said Carfax. &#8220;Suppose
we go now and take up the trail of the two
surveyors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The track of the second buggy proved to be a
short scent soon lost. Within a hundred yards
of its turning-point opposite the glade the buggy
had left the wood road, the tracks swerving to
the right in a direction opposite to that taken by
the earlier vehicle; and neither the wheels nor
the hoofs of the horse had left any impress on the
thick carpeting of fallen leaves under the trees;
or none that amateur trailers could see and follow.</p>

<p>They were returning down the by-road when a
crash and a hoarse roar of escaping steam notified
them that once more something had gone
wrong with the machinery. Carfax threw up his
head like a thoroughbred starting in a race.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been hunting for causes,&#8221; he snapped:
&#8220;there is effect number one, right now! I can
outrun you to the home plate!&#8221;</p>

<p>They came upon the scene, neck and neck,
just after Rucker had stopped the engine and
opened his fire-door. The walking-beam had
fallen again, carrying down a portion of the derrick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
framework; and the mountaineer whose name
on the pay-roll appeared as &#8220;Morgan,&#8221; and who
had been drill-turning in Sawyer&#8217;s place at the
moment, was caught and held under the wreckage.</p>

<p>Happily, the man was neither killed nor very
severely injured. A few minutes&#8217; quick work,
to which everybody lent a hand, sufficed to extricate
him from the mass of broken timbers;
and a rather ugly scalp wound, which Carfax
proceeded deftly to wash and dress and bandage,
figured as the worst of his hurts.</p>

<p>Tregarvon sent the man home in charge of the
other masquerading McNabb; and then came
the reckoning with the smashed drilling plant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we in for this time, Rucker?&#8221; was
the owner&#8217;s question, put after the machinist
had measured the damage with a critical eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly a couple o&#8217; days&#8217; hang-up, I guess.
Leave me a man or two to help me blacksmith,
and I&#8217;ll see what I can do. But what&#8217;s eatin&#8217;
me is, what done it?&#8221;</p>

<p>There seemed to be no categorical answer to
this, the cause of the breakdown being as yet
well hidden in the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the effect. Tregarvon
was willing to charge it to the chapter of
accidents, but Carfax was less easily satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were the first,&#8221; he demurred; &#8220;but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
isn&#8217;t. There is an entire series behind it. And,
coming right on the heels of the little mysteries
of last night ... I&#8217;m of the opinion that this
is the beginning of more hostilities, Vance.&#8221;
Then to Rucker: &#8220;How far did you get the hole
down, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more than a couple o&#8217; feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drilling hard?&#8221; asked Tregarvon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-m-m; middlin&#8217; hard; &#8217;bout like the one
we put down over yonder at the head of the
tramway&mdash;the first one we drilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon told off three of the laborers to help
Rucker, and sent the remaining three back to
Coalville to report to Tryon, who, with another
small squad, was replacing rotted cross-ties on
the lower end of the tramway. After this, he
beckoned to Carfax, and they went together
down the shallow glade ravine to the spot where
Rucker had found the burnt pine-knot torch
and had driven his marking stake.</p>

<p>Out of hearing of the four men left at the drilling-stand,
Tregarvon said: &#8220;Well, the McNabbs
are eliminated, definitely. It is fair to assume
that a man wouldn&#8217;t be so careless as to get
caught in a trap of his own setting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would think not,&#8221; was Carfax&#8217;s rejoinder;
but he did not say that it was impossible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>On the ground where the torch-bearer of the
previous night had stood they searched carefully
for something that might give a working clue
to the mystery of the moonlight survey. There
was nothing, unless an oak-tree, with a half-overgrown
&#8220;blaze&#8221; and some ancient markings
cut in it, might be called a clue.</p>

<p>Two or three hundred feet below the scarred
oak lay the cliff edge, at this point something
less than a precipice. Tregarvon stood on the
brink, looking down over the rough, broken talus.
A hundred yards below his perch the gray ribbon
of the mountain pike leading to Coalville
wound in and out among the trees and huge
boulders. Farther around to the left, and almost
on a level with the broken talus, he could see
the head of the Ocoee tramway. At once he called
Carfax&#8217;s attention to the favoring topographies.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we should find our big vein anywhere between
here and the tramhead, it would be almost
as accessible as the old opening,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
track could be continued on an easy curve and
grade, and there is drop enough to give us the
gravity haul. I wonder if any one has ever
looked along here for the outcrop?&#8221;</p>

<p>Viewed from the summit, the rough declivity,
rocky, wooded, and thickly-covered with a matted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
tangle of brier, laurel, and undergrowth, looked as
if it had never been trodden by the foot of man.
Carfax, leaning against a tree which grew on the
extreme edge of the cliff, gave it as his opinion
that the rocky slope had never felt the prospector&#8217;s
pick.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have to dig trenches or holes or something,
in prospecting for coal, don&#8217;t they?&#8221; he
asked; and when Tregarvon confirmed the surmise:
&#8220;I should say that this toboggan-slide is
just as old Madam Nature left it, shouldn&#8217;t you?
Can we get from here to the tramhead without
going back and around and over the mountain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easily,&#8221; said Tregarvon, and he swung out
and dropped over the low cliff to lead the way
along the broken ledges.</p>

<p>It was while Carfax was lowering himself with
more care than Tregarvon had taken, with the
leaning tree to help, that he made a small discovery
and called Tregarvon back. On its outer
or valley-facing side the leaning tree carried a
&#8220;blazed&#8221; scar with markings similar to those on
the white-oak half-way between the cliff and the
glade. Like the other scar, this one was old, and
the bark had long since healed around the edges
of the ax-wound. But the markings, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
were cut into the heart-wood, were still quite
distinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Tregarvon, after they had examined
the scar together, &#8220;what do you make of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was pencilling the mark on the back
of the letter upon which he had sketched the
damp-sand hoof-prints.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It looks something like the
Greek letter &#8216;<i>pi</i>&#8217;, a capital &#8216;T&#8217; with two stems,
don&#8217;t you think? But, of course, that is only a
coincidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it, though?&#8221; queried Tregarvon thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be. What woodsman in this part
of the world would ever mark a tree with a Greek
letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No woodsman, perhaps; but a schoolmaster
might. Poictiers, I am slowly coming around to
your point of view. Hartridge is at the bottom
of all these smash-ups and mysteries. I hate to
believe it of him, but everything leans in his
direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks that way, doesn&#8217;t it? But the admission
of the fact doesn&#8217;t clear up the mysteries.
Say that, for some reason, sentimental or other,
Hartridge wishes to drive you out&mdash;make you
quit. That might explain the smash-ups and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
hindrances; but it doesn&#8217;t begin to explain why
we should find these marks of his&mdash;if they are his&mdash;made
on these two trees years and years ago;
or why he should send a pair of surveyors up here
to make monkey motions in the moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was leading the way along the ledge
toward the tramhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall probably find out more about all
these things before we are much older on the
job,&#8221; he replied; and then, vengefully: &#8220;If I
can catch him at it, I promise you I&#8217;ll make him
sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>After they reached the head of the inclined
track and had signalled to Tryon at the foot to
let them down in the tip-car, Tregarvon outlined
his plan for the broken day.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go down and get out the auto and my
engineering instruments, motor back to the drilling
plant, and do a little surveying on our own
account. Beyond that, you may take the car
and kill time with it as you please. I&#8217;ll stay and
help Rucker.&#8221;</p>

<p>The programme was carried out in due course.
By ten o&#8217;clock they were back on the mountain
top with the surveying instruments. Placing the
transit upon the tripod marks under the tree on
the edge of the glade, Tregarvon took a forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
sight to the eastward, with Carfax holding the
target-staff on the spot where the burnt torch was
found. Then, without changing the position of
the instrument, Tregarvon signalled Carfax to
go back, halting him at the cliff edge, and moving
him to right and left until the target was once
more in line with the cross-hairs of the telescope.</p>

<p>&#8220;What developments?&#8221; he inquired, when the
staff-bearer came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing startling. Your line of sight merely
picked up the second of the two marked trees,
whatever significance that may have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure it has some significance, if
we were shrewd enough to figure it out,&#8221; Tregarvon
asserted. Then: &#8220;What will you do with
yourself until dinner-time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know; chase around in the car
awhile, maybe, if you can&#8217;t use me here. Perhaps
I may be able to pick up a clue or so&mdash;if I
can find anybody to talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon stripped off his coat and went to
work with Rucker and the helpers, and in this
manner the better part of the day was accounted
for. Late in the afternoon, when the blacksmithing
of new irons left him without an occupation,
he yielded to a prompting which had been urging
him all day, and went for a long tramp which took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
him over the route covered by the drilling plant
in its several removals.</p>

<p>The sun had gone behind the mountain when
he finally came out at the tramhead and signalled
for the cable-car to take him down. Tryon answered
the signal and started the machinery, and
in a few minutes Tregarvon was landed at the
Coalville level, where he found Carfax waiting for
him on the porch of the office-building.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beat you to it,&#8221; said the golden youth; and
then, whimsically: &#8220;What do you know now
more than you knew before you knew so little as
you know now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon cast himself down upon the porch-step.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, after a bit. Did you find
out anything new?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing very conclusive. Item number one
is that there are only two horses in the Highmount
stables; neither of them white, and neither
with a broken toe-calk on the left hind foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon smiled wearily. &#8220;More negative information;
it&#8217;s always negative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and you may put into the same basket
the item that no one of the half-dozen people I
asked knew of any white horse owned on the
mountain. But I picked up one little pointer that
belongs in the other basket&mdash;the positive. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
luncheon at Highmount&mdash;upon Mrs. Caswell&#8217;s
very pressing invitation. At table, Miss Richardia
wanted to know how you came to plant
your drilling-machine right in the middle of the
old burying-ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean to say that the glade is a graveyard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that it used to be, many years ago&mdash;for
the slaves. You will remember that you remarked
the sunken spots in the only bit of soft
earth there is, and wondered what made them.
They are graves. Do you suppose Rucker would
sleep any better to-night than he did last night
if he knew that? If he had known it last night,
perhaps it might have accounted for some of his
restlessness. But I&#8217;m drifting from the point,
which is that Miss Richardia&#8217;s question betrayed
her: she was the young woman who drove
with the man behind the white horse; otherwise
she would not have known about the location of
the drilling plant in the glade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t follow,&#8221; Tregarvon objected.
&#8220;Some one might have told her. But let that
part of it go. Did you discover anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. After school hours I took Miss Farron,
Miss Longstreet, and the French teacher out for
a spin in the car. Miss Richardia said she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
couldn&#8217;t go because she had another engagement.
We made a rather long round to the south and
came back to Highmount by a road which parallels
the western brow of the mountain. Are you
paying attention?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breathless attention,&#8221; said Tregarvon ironically.
&#8220;Joy-ride stories always make me sit up.
Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over on the west-brow road we passed a place
which looked as if it might be&mdash;or might some
time have been&mdash;a gentleman&#8217;s country house.
It is walled in from the road, with a magnificently
groved lawn, a box-bordered, weed-grown carriage
drive, and a great, rambling, porticoed mansion
needing the repair-man pretty savagely. Still
sitting up and taking notice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as were rolling up to pass the stone-pillared
lodge-gates a horse and buggy came out,
with a young woman driving. The horse was
old and countrified, and he didn&#8217;t take kindly to
the auto. So I stopped and got out to lead him
past the machine. You won&#8217;t want to believe
it, but the young woman driver was Miss Richardia;
and the horse&mdash;well, no horseman
would call it white, to be sure. It was a dapple-gray,
light enough to pass for white in the moonlight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and with a mechanician like Rucker for the
color expert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon came out of his listless mood with a
snap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it be said, once for all, Poictiers, that I
won&#8217;t stand for any theory that involves Richardia
Birrell in the crooked part of it,&#8221; he declared
firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;d trust her with anything I own;
with my life, if she cared to borrow it. That
dapple-gray suggestion of yours makes my back
ache! It isn&#8217;t worthy of you. Rucker said
&#8216;white,&#8217; and white isn&#8217;t gray; not by a long shot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Carfax, evenly. &#8220;After I had
led the horse safely past the car, I made sure.
&#8216;Hold on a minute, Miss Richardia,&#8217; said I, &#8216;let
me see if your horse hasn&#8217;t a pebble in his shoe.&#8217;
That gave me an excuse to lift his near hind foot.
There wasn&#8217;t any pebble, of course, but the shoe
was badly worn, <i>and the toe-calk had a piece broken
out of it</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon maintained a stubborn silence for a
full minute. Then he denied again, with more
heat than the occasion seemed to demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what evidence you bring. I&#8217;ll
believe nothing against Richardia; <i>nothing</i>, you
understand? And, after all, what does it amount
to? We agreed this morning that she might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
blamelessly take an evening drive with Hartridge.
The fact that they were driving behind her
father&#8217;s horse cuts no especial figure that I can
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She might have been driving with Hartridge
blamelessly; we agree on that. Or even still
more blamelessly with&mdash;her father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it in words,&#8221; snapped Tregarvon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two or three people to whom I have spoken
saw them together behind the dapple-gray, her
and her father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t stand for it!&#8221; was the angry retort.
&#8220;You are hinting that her father is behind these
bushwhackings, and that she is a party to them.
That doesn&#8217;t go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was spoken very much like a lover,&#8221;
said Carfax slowly. And then: &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t
let your major weakness get away with you,
Vance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you call my &#8216;major weakness&#8217;?&#8221;
Tregarvon inquired, with a rasp to the words
that made them sound like a challenge.</p>

<p>Carfax did not mince matters. &#8220;The inability
to be off with the old love before you are on with
the new,&#8221; he said crisply. &#8220;Elizabeth has some
rights which you ought to respect, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; Tregarvon jerked out. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
said it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t; but I shall say it all. You
are a changed man, Vance. Either this coal-mine
fight or your infatuation for this young
woman, or both, are bringing out the worst
there is in you. Don&#8217;t you realize it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I realize that this is a devil of a world!&#8221; was
the gritting rejoinder. &#8220;First Richardia puts
the knife into me and twists it around, and now
you&#8217;re doing it. I suppose it will be Elizabeth&#8217;s
turn, next!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You deserve all that is coming to you, I venture
to say,&#8221; suggested the mentor evenly. &#8220;You
are engaged to one woman, and you come here
and make love openly to another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was lost now to all sense of proportion.
&#8220;I shall do as I please!&#8221; he retorted hotly.
&#8220;If you want to write to Elizabeth, it&#8217;s your
privilege. If you do, I shall tell her that
you&#8217;ve had Richardia out in the car twice to
my once!&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s mentor mood slipped away, and he
laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Richardia is a dear girl, and worthy of
the best that any man can give her, Vance,&#8221; he
said gently. &#8220;Somebody ought to save her from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the machinations of a William Wilberforce Hartridge,
don&#8217;t you think? You can&#8217;t, you know;
and sometimes I&#8217;ve wondered if that doesn&#8217;t put
it pretty squarely up to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon rose and stood over his friend, and
for an instant there were black passions to blaze
in the wide-set gray eyes. But there was manhood
enough underlying the tumult to enable
him to throttle the worst of the impulses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I guess I&#8217;m just a jealous dog in the manger,
Poictiers,&#8221; he confessed gratingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had a hunch that it was going that way, and I&#8217;ve
been resenting it&mdash;like the damned scoundrel I&#8217;m
coming to be. But it&#8217;s all over now, and&mdash;and I
wish you joy. Can I say more than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax looked up with a quaint twinkle in his
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking you might say a good bit more,
only you are too charitable to turn the whole
menagerie loose. Shall we go in and get ready
to eat? Uncle William will be calling us in a
minute or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until after the dinner had been eaten,
and they were smoking bedtime pipes before the
dining-room fire, that Tregarvon went back to
the discoveries of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;About the time you were going for your drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
this afternoon, I took a walk,&#8221; he said, by way
of prefacing the story of the last of the discoveries.
&#8220;I went over the ground we have been covering
with the drill, examining every inch of it as if I
had lost the set out of a diamond ring. I know
now why we have been permitted to go on drilling
holes in the rock without interference.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a hint of my own:
I wonder if you are not going to confirm it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. At any rate, I found that somebody
else had been over precisely the same ground
with a test-drill a good while ago. I located five
holes in all, each of them filled to the top, of
course, with sand and washings. One of these
holes isn&#8217;t twenty feet from the last one we drilled
before we moved to the present location in the
graveyard glade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; said Carfax, absently rolling a cigarette
between his palms. &#8220;That was my guess,
based upon a word that Hartridge let drop the
day I drove him down here to eat with us. I
suppose the corollary to that is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the accident that smashed things this
morning was &#8216;assisted,&#8217; as the others have been.
So long as we went on drilling in dead ground it
wasn&#8217;t worth while to interfere. But now that
we are trying a new wrinkle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Carfax got up and returned the softened cigarette
to its place in his pocket-case.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better sleep on that corollary
of yours, Vance,&#8221; he suggested mildly. &#8220;If it
looks as plausible in daylight as it does now, I
don&#8217;t know but we had better call out the militia
and give Rucker more help in the night-watching.
Anyway, we&#8217;ll see how it stacks up in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI<br />


<small>Rosemary and Rue</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE better impulses had been all to the fore
when Tregarvon had wished his friend a
fair field and no favor at Highmount. But between
a burst of generosity on the spur of a repentant
moment and a day-by-day renouncing of
a pearl of price there is apt to lie a <i>via dolorosa</i>
plentifully bestrewn with stone bruises for misguided
feet. On the day following the evening
of plain speech Tregarvon toiled manfully with
Rucker and the laborers in the repairing of the
damaged machinery; but he did it without prejudice
to a good many sharp-pointed reflections
basing themselves upon Carfax&#8217;s blunt accusation,
upon the golden youth&#8217;s calm interference, and
upon the fact that, late in the forenoon, Carfax,
apparently tired of looking on and doing nothing
at the scene of the repairing activities, had
strolled away through the forest in the direction
of Highmount.</p>

<p>There was more than one disturbing string to
the bow of reflection. At first, Miss Birrell had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
openly made a good-natured mock of Carfax,
with his small affectations to point her gibings;
but Tregarvon was now impecunious enough
himself to appreciate the potency of money.
Miss Richardia had told him a little about the
Birrell fortunes&mdash;or the lack of them; of the
vanishing of the family possessions in the aftermath
of the Civil War; of the fact that her
father, once the leading jurist of the Cumberland
counties&mdash;Miss Richardia did not say this,
but Tregarvon easily inferred it&mdash;had found
himself out of touch with the later and more
pushing spirit of the New South, and had withdrawn
more and more until he had become almost
a hermit. The Carfax millions were enough
to tempt any young woman; and Carfax himself&mdash;Tregarvon
admitted it without bitterness&mdash;was
a man to whom most women were attracted
and whom all women trusted.</p>

<p>But was Carfax really in love with Judge
Birrell&#8217;s daughter? Tregarvon boasted that he
had summered and wintered the golden youth;
yet there were depths in him that the Philadelphian
suspected no one had ever fully plumbed.
In Tregarvon&#8217;s knowing of him he had always
been, or appeared to be, immune to sentiment;
his attitude had been that of a gentle-natured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
soul who was willing to be used, or even abused,
without detriment to an impartial affection for
the entire sex. Would such a man be able to
make Richardia as happy as she deserved to be?
In the intimacy which Tregarvon had pressed
to its ultimate limits he had come to know that
behind the cool, slate-blue eyes and the lips that
lent themselves so readily to playful mockery
there was a passionate soul which would give all
and demand all; which would starve on a diet of
mere affection, however kindly and indulgent.
Would the Carfax millions outweigh this demand?
It was an irritating question, refusing
to be answered.</p>

<p>Tregarvon, driving bolts into the patched
derrick frame, strove dejectedly to put his own
huge misfortune aside as a matter definitely
settled. He admitted, with pricklings of shame,
the truth, or at least the half-truth, of Carfax&#8217;s
accusation&mdash;the charge of fickleness. In a light-hearted
way he had been devoted to many
women, for the moment, and the nearest woman
had always been the loadstone. He excused the
weakness by saying that it was common to all
men&mdash;thereby touching a truth larger than he
knew; excused it further by laying down the
broad principle that Richardia Birrell, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
numerically the last, was really the first woman
who had ever broken through to the inner depths
of him.</p>

<p>Just here he had a saving glimpse of the workings
of the normal masculine mind, and it jogged
his sense of humor. Was not the latest charmer
always the pearl of great price; the one altogether
lovely? Perhaps; but in this case, he
told himself, it was different. The Richardias
are few and far between; and he had discovered
one of the precious few only to realize that he
was bound in honor to relinquish her without a
murmur to a Carfax, or even to a Hartridge.
It was a part of the irrefrangible vanity of the
male to regard the relinquishment as a voluntary
virtue on his part. In all the gnawings of
the worm of reflection, girdings at his hard lot,
questionings as to Richardia&#8217;s future happiness,
gratulatory back-pattings at his own magnanimity
in leaving the field to Carfax, it did not occur
to him that Richardia, herself, might have had
something to say to his own suit&mdash;if he had been
able, as a man of honor, to press it. Like many
other men, he comforted himself with the cheerful
assumption that, in the absence of the abnormal
obstacles, any man may win any woman,
if he shall only put his mind to it; a doctrine, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
may be said, which is still lacking proof in certain
isolated instances.</p>

<p>Thus giving himself over to the bitterness&mdash;and
the self-glorification&mdash;of the afterthought,
Tregarvon wore out the day, deferring to Rucker
as boss of the repairing job, and trying not to
speculate too pointedly upon the doings of the
absent Carfax. That the golden youth was once
more a drop-in guest at the near-by school was
not to be doubted; and the caviller at an unkind
fate steeled himself against another disloyalty&mdash;a
temptation to rail at the New Yorker for
making such unseemly haste. The ill-natured
thought would have likened Carfax&#8217;s haste to
that which prompts the heir-at-law to open and
read the will while the testator is as yet merely in
the throes of the death-agony&mdash;only Tregarvon
would not yield to the temptation.</p>

<p>If the murmurer against fate could have seen
beyond the half-mile of forest which intervened
between the old slave burying-ground and
Highmount, he would have concluded sorrowfully
that Carfax&#8217;s haste was well on the way
to its reward. Miss Richardia&#8217;s duty hours in
the afternoon were short, and at three o&#8217;clock she
was free to join the golden one, who, as Tregarvon&#8217;s
prefiguring had assumed, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Mrs. Caswell&#8217;s luncheon guest, and was now
making himself at home on the broad veranda
of the administration building. For a time the
talk rambled through Boston byways and was
reminiscent of Miss Richardia&#8217;s sojourn as a
Conservatory student and of Carfax&#8217;s quickly
abandoned attempt to take a postgraduate
course in the School of Naval Architecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I didn&#8217;t have the spur,&#8221; was Carfax&#8217;s
excuse for the abandoned attempt. Then,
in an apparent burst of enthusiasm: &#8220;Vance is
the lucky fellow! He is obliged to work. He
thinks it is pretty hard lines, but he doesn&#8217;t
know how jolly good it is for his soul. It is precisely
what he is needing, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Work? yes; but the many disappointments:
are they also good for the soul?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s smile was entirely amiable. &#8220;In due
proportion, they are, I should say. Vance has
been like a bit of soft steel, needing the forge
fire and the tempering brine bath. I presume
you know that he is engaged to be married?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Richardia&#8217;s smile was of the sort that
no mere man may interpret.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he has told me all there was to tell.
Are you acquainted with Miss Wardwell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well acquainted, indeed. She is all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
that any man could ask&mdash;and more,&#8221; said Carfax,
with more warmth than he usually permitted
himself. &#8220;Last summer she was a member of
a Lake Placid outing-party in which I had the
good fortune also to be included. We became
quite chummy. She swims, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Miss Birrell&#8217;s smile was a charming
little mask of impenetrability.</p>

<p>&#8220;These athletic young women!&#8221; she sighed.
&#8220;It is their day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean that Eliz&mdash;that Miss Wardwell
is offensively athletic. I wouldn&#8217;t have you
think that. She&mdash;she is musical and all the other
things that a young woman ought to be; but she
enjoys the outdoor things, too. And so do I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Tregarvon doesn&#8217;t enjoy them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in a way,&#8221; was the qualifying rejoinder.
&#8220;Vance&#8217;s misfortune has been, that, until quite
recently, he has never wanted anything that he
couldn&#8217;t simply reach out and take; he has
never been obliged to throw himself whole-heartedly
into anything. He is doing it now,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Into the Ocoee, you mean? I am afraid there
is nothing but disappointment for him there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was silent for a moment. Then he
said: &#8220;There are times, Miss Richardia, when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
have the feeling that every one who knows what
he is trying to do wishes him to be disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Including us here at Highmount?&#8221; she
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would be willing to make it even
more definite. Do you include me with Mr.
Tregarvon&#8217;s ill-wishers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ve been tempted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know why you should say
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said it,&#8221; Carfax returned, with the
gentle doggedness which he could assume when
the need was sufficiently pressing. &#8220;I shall be
delighted to be assured that I am mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now came Miss Richardia&#8217;s opportunity to
fall silent, and she improved it. When she spoke
again the playful mockery was laid aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father was one of the sorriest of the
losers in the Ocoee in the promoting period,&#8221;
she began soberly. &#8220;This entire mountain top
was once a part of the Birrell estate; my grandfather
gave the site for this school. When Mr.
Parker was promoting the Ocoee, father went
into the plan, heart and soul, giving a large part
of the land, and putting all the money he could
rake and scrape into the stock of Mr. Parker&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
company. Worse than that, he was so firmly
convinced of the future success of the undertaking
that he persuaded his friends to invest. You
mustn&#8217;t expect us to be very enthusiastic now,
Mr. Carfax. It isn&#8217;t in human nature to rejoice
when others are preparing to reap where we have
sown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s smile was angel-compassionate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Vance isn&#8217;t reaping very successfully
as yet,&#8221; he pointed out. Then he added: &#8220;I
hope your good father doesn&#8217;t feel vindictive
toward him. I think we may safely say that
Vance is the innocent third party in the transaction&mdash;if
there ever is such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know my father; if you did, you
would hardly accuse him of vindictiveness, even
in your thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you say as much for yourself?&#8221; asked
the accuser gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t put a straw in Vance&#8217;s way, if
you could?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would listen!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Do I
look like a&mdash;a subterranean plotter, Mr. Carfax?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always look charming. But you don&#8217;t
want Vance to succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know why you should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
think such a thing. Perhaps you don&#8217;t think it.
I can never tell when you are really in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange that you should have noticed that.
Others have said it of me, too, at times. But I
am very much in earnest this afternoon. It lies
in your hands to make Vance fail most conspicuously,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are fond of riddles, and I am not. I
wish you would be more explicit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax stole a glance aside at his veranda
companion and it was borne in upon him that he
would have to choose his words carefully. The
slate-blue eyes had grown a trifle hard, and Miss
Richardia&#8217;s tone was no longer sympathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vance can&#8217;t mix business and sentiment very
well,&#8221; he ventured. &#8220;He has been spending a
good bit of time here at Highmount, forgetting
some things that he ought to remember. Surely
you have discovered his one weakness by this
time, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; he went on, gravely pleading.
&#8220;Not that it isn&#8217;t tremendously excusable
in the present instance, you know. You&mdash;er&mdash;you
are enough to turn any man&#8217;s head, Miss
Richardia; you are, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her little shriek of laughter was sufficient to
break any thin skim of ice which may have been
congealing between them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;You can be quite as absurd as Mr. Vance,
himself, when you try!&#8221; she mocked. Then,
with the frankness which was all her own: &#8220;Are
you trying to tell me that I have been playing
the part of a modern Delilah, Mr. Carfax!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no! But&#8221;&mdash;he swallowed hard
once or twice, and then took the plunge&mdash;&#8220;but
Vance simply couldn&#8217;t help falling in love with
you. Er&mdash;hardly any man could. And it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s
smashing him to perfection. I don&#8217;t say
that he is admitting the&mdash;the little lapse, even
to himself; he is too honorable to do that, after
he has given his word to Eliz&mdash;to Miss Wardwell.
But the fact remains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Richardia laughed again, but now the
laugh scarcely rang true.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are making me out a poor, miserable
sinner; though I am a most innocent one, I do
assure you,&#8221; she protested, not without a suggestion
of sarcasm. &#8220;What is it you wish me to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax needed no one to tell him that he was
wading in deep waters, and that another step
might put him in over his head. Yet he could
not retreat; he had gone too far.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been trying to hammer a little common
sense into Vance; perhaps I have said more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
even a good friend has a right to say. Hitherto
it hasn&#8217;t done much good; but last night I had
a perfectly brilliant inspiration. I wonder if you
could be induced to help me carry it out?&mdash;just
in the interests of a&mdash;of a square deal all around,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another absurdity?&#8221; she queried, half scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just that; a&mdash;a most ridiculous absurdity.
Will you&mdash;er&mdash;will you marry me, Miss
Richardia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly not,&#8221; she returned, with a
strained little laugh. &#8220;Why should I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any reason at all, of course,&#8221; he
hastened to say. &#8220;But if you would make your
answer not quite so&mdash;er&mdash;so positive: if you
would be so generous as to&mdash;er&mdash;to seem to take
it under consideration; just until Vance can get
on his feet again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This time her laughter was wholly mirthful;
an abandonment of all hamperings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all preposterous askings!&#8221; she gasped.
&#8220;Are there many more like you, Mr. Carfax&mdash;in
New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of them,&#8221; he assured her, not too seriously.
Then: &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be such a dreadful
thing, would it? I can make love very nicely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
you know; honestly, I can. And we shouldn&#8217;t
have to do anything more than to keep up appearances.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to humor you far enough to
even pretend to take you seriously,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even for Vance&#8217;s sake? Of course, I
know you don&#8217;t care for him, particularly, but
I do; he has been like a brother to me, Miss
Richardia; really he has. And we ought to make
him realize what he is about; it&#8217;s&mdash;er&mdash;it&#8217;s a sort
of duty, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I should tell you what I think I am afraid
it might sound dreadfully unkind, Mr. Carfax.
You seem to have had very little experience with
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I have, you know,&#8221; he burst out.
&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m in love, myself&mdash;with&mdash;with some one I
can&#8217;t possibly marry. That ought to make you
feel sorry for me, and I&#8217;m sure it does. Perhaps
you are in a similar situation yourself; in love
with some one else, I mean. In that case&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Richardia had risen, and the mocking
mood was once more firmly intrenched behind
her laughing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have given me a most delicious half-hour,
Mr. Carfax, and in the days to come, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
I feel particularly blue, I shall always have it to
look back to and remember. You are not expecting
me to say any more than that, are you?
I can&#8217;t, you know, because I have an appointment
with a pupil, and I shall have to go and keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax had risen with her. &#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly delighted
to be your laughing-stock,&#8221; he asserted
gently. &#8220;You&#8217;ll let me come and be it again?
Thanks, awfully.&#8221; And when she was gone he
sat down like a man who has been through a
pass perilous, and smoked three of the imported
cigarettes in rapid succession.</p>

<p>That evening, returning from the hard day&#8217;s
work on the repairs, the owner of the Ocoee found
Carfax awaiting him in the office headquarters
at the foot of Pisgah. Uncle William&#8217;s dinner,
served as soon as Tregarvon had taken his bath,
was not provocative of conversation; and even
afterward the talk, revolving around the repairs
and the mystery, was only desultory. It was not
until Tregarvon was smoking his bedtime pipe
that he dug the one important thing out of his
mind and flung it at his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You spent the day at Highmount, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no; not quite so bad as that. I&#8217;ve
been down here since half-past four or such a
matter.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;But you went to the college after you left
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and Mrs. Caswell was good enough to
give me something to eat at the proper time.
She makes one believe all the old-time stories of
Southern hospitality. Which reminds me: we
are both invited there to dinner to-morrow evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon refused to be turned aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t go to Highmount to visit with
Mrs. Caswell,&#8221; he suggested sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not altogether; no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see Richardia?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax had lighted his candle and was preparing
to beat a hasty retreat, did retreat as far as
the door before he turned to say: &#8220;Yes, I saw I
Miss Richardia. You wished me joy, last night,
Vance, and I hope you are going to do it again.
I&#8217;ve asked her to marry me, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What!</i>&#8221; shouted Tregarvon, springing from
his chair. And then, with a mighty effort to
keep the words from choking him: &#8220;What did
she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax smiled like a winning angel. &#8220;She&mdash;well,
it seemed to strike her as being a bit sudden,
as you might say, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_162.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Carfax stopped abruptly and said no more.</p>

<p>Tregarvon had dropped into a chair beside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
table, and was hiding his face in the crook of an
elbow. Carfax stopped abruptly and said no
more; and when he closed the door behind him
it was done so gently that the latch made no
sound.</p>

<small>Dull Steel</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RUCKER proved as good as his word in the
matter of estimating the delay, two days
sufficing for the work of restoration. Having
made a test run in the evening after Tregarvon
had gone down the mountain, the mechanician
had the machinery whirling merrily to the <i>chug
chug</i> of the drill by the time his two bosses came
on the ground the following morning.</p>

<p>Among his better qualities Tregarvon was able
to number a certain degree of resilience which,
given time to take the full impact of a blow,
could recover and rebound and make the best
of the inevitable. Whatever might have come
of the intimacy with Richardia Birrell&mdash;and he
told himself that nothing could have come of it
in any event&mdash;it was now an episode ended; and
after a night of very much mingled emotions, he
had risen up with the determination to play the
man, for Carfax&#8217;s sake if not for his own, and to
let the industrial battle fill all the horizons for
one Vance Tregarvon. With this determination
firmly seated in the saddle, he had constrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
himself to meet Carfax at breakfast without bitterness;
to motor with him up the mountain in terms
of good-fellowship; and, upon their arrival, to
shout cheerfully to Rucker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got her going all right again, have you,
Billy? Any more puzzle people come to see you
last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rucker grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to lie about it, Mr. Tregarvon.
What with pushin&#8217; the job so bloomin&#8217; hard
yesterday, and losin&#8217; so much sleep between
whiles, I guess they might&#8217;ve come and lugged
me off bodily without my knowin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t find anything wrong this
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no; not to say just wrong; only sort o&#8217;
spookerish.&#8221; Then, in a tone that the men at
the drill might not hear: &#8220;There was somebody
here again last night&mdash;humans &#8217;r ghosts. I had
a fit o&#8217; the jumps a while back that everlastin&#8217;ly
swiped my appetite for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221; asked Tregarvon, looking
up from his inspection of the yellow car&#8217;s motor;
and Carfax said: &#8220;It must have been something
pretty fierce, Billy, if it crippled your pneumogastric
nerve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was this way,&#8221; Rucker explained. &#8220;Last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
night, after we got the derrick rigged again, I
starts and runs the engine for a little while, just
to make sure everything is in workin&#8217; order.
When I shuts down, I banks the fire under the
boiler so it&#8217;ll keep overnight. &#8217;Long about sunrise
this mornin&#8217; I hikes over to stir her up for
business, and when I yanks the fire-box door open,
it&#8217;s me for throwin&#8217; that fit o&#8217; the jumps. There
was the yallerist, cockiest-lookin&#8217; skull you ever
see, settin&#8217; on top o&#8217; the banked fire, ready to
pull a grin on me when I opens the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A skull?&mdash;a human skull?&#8221; exclaimed Tregarvon
incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep; a yaller one; all teeth and eye-holes,
and with a sort of greasy black smoke comin&#8217;
out o&#8217; the place where its nose ought to &#8217;a&#8217; been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did it get there?&#8221; Carfax asked the
question and then answered it himself by adding:
&#8220;But, of course, you don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rucker was wiping his face with a piece of cotton
waste&mdash;the machinist&#8217;s handkerchief. The
autumn morning was cool and bracing on the
mountain top, yet the perspiration stood in fine
little beads on his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know; and if you was to search
me all day, you&#8217;d never get it out o&#8217; me where it
come from, &#8217;r who put it there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
ain&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call jumpy, but after it was
all over, I didn&#8217;t want no breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do with it?&#8221; Tregarvon
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? I jammed it back into the coals with
the clinker hook, and put the blower on, quick!
Says I, &#8216;All right, my bucko! You make me throw
a fit, and I&#8217;ll make you make steam!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens! You burned it?&#8221; Tregarvon was
still conventional enough to be half horrified,
and Carfax shuddered in sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certain&#8217;y did. But he got back at me,
right now! In less &#8217;n five minutes by the watch
that old boiler was red-hot and blowin&#8217; off steam
to beat the band. She was sweatin&#8217; black smoke
at every joint; and when I chases &#8217;round to
open the fire-door&mdash;Well, you needn&#8217;t believe me
if you don&#8217;t want to, but them grate-bars was
drippin&#8217; something &#8217;r other that looked like
burnin&#8217; blood!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a point beyond which the thread of
sympathetic horror snaps, and the ball rebounds
into the field of the ridiculous.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do for you, Billy,&#8221; Tregarvon
laughed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll allow you the skull, but you
needn&#8217;t embroider it for us. Somebody played a
grisly joke on you&mdash;with no particular object,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
that I can see. Just the same, it has its significance.
Some prowler was sneaking around here
while you were asleep. Are you sure the drill
is working all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see for yourself,&#8221; said Rucker, not
unboastfully. &#8220;She&#8217;s jumpin&#8217; up and down to
the old tune of forty to the minute, same as I
promised you she&#8217;d be this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a closer inspection proved that Rucker&#8217;s
boast was loyal to the eye but a traitor to the
fact. The drill was merely &#8220;jumping up and
down.&#8221; It was hardly cutting its own clearance;
had gained in depth less than half an inch
in half an hour, according to the report of Sawyer,
who was at his customary post, &#8220;churning and
turning&#8221; at the hole.</p>

<p>Rucker looked on critically for a few minutes
and then laid a listening ear to the steel, bowing
and recovering in unison with the stroke.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hit a bone o&#8217; some kind,&#8221; was his verdict;
and he stopped the churning machinery
and threw in the hoist by means of which the
heavy cutting-bar was lifted from the hole.</p>

<p>An examination of the drill point amply verified
the mechanician&#8217;s guess that something
much harder than the fine-gritted sandstone of
the mountain top had been encountered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
bottom of the test-hole. The cutting edges of
the drill burr were completely gone, broken
down and gnawed smooth until the steel cutter-bar
was no more than a blunt-ended ram.</p>

<p>Tregarvon swore painstakingly, anathematizing
the demon of ill luck by bell, book, and candle,
thereby further emphasizing the distance he had
travelled on the road toward things elemental.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scrap it,&#8221; he snapped, meaning the ruined
drill point. &#8220;How many more have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; put another one in and drive it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rucker got out a fresh point, mounted and
lowered it, and the churning was resumed.
Three hours of steady thumping showed a gain
of less than two inches in the depth of the hole,
and at the end of that time the second drill burr
was worn as smooth as the first.</p>

<p>This went on until the last of the four cutters
was put in service. For a wasted day of patient
churning the hole had gone down only a few
inches, and Rucker was in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;When this cutter goes, we&#8217;re hung up for
more &#8217;n any day &#8217;r two,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;I can
sharpen these points all right enough, but it&#8217;ll
take scads o&#8217; time with the tools we&#8217;ve got here
on the job. You two bosses hain&#8217;t made up your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
minds what t&#8217; &#8217;ell it is we&#8217;re tryin&#8217; to chew through
down yonder, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon had taken an engineering course in
the university, but he was no geologist; and Carfax&#8217;s
equipment was even less hopeful. It was a
case for a specialist; and the specialist turned
up at the opportune moment in the person of
Mr. Guy Wilmerding, who had ridden over from
Whitlow to see how the Ocoee experiment was
progressing.</p>

<p>His coming was hailed with acclamations by
the two amateurs.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Wilmerding, you&#8217;re just in time to
save us from strait-jackets and a padded cell!&#8221;
Tregarvon exclaimed. &#8220;What kind of rock do
you have in this region that will make a drill
point look like that?&#8221; showing the C. C. &amp; I.
superintendent one of the blunted cutters.</p>

<p>Wilmerding scrutinized the dulled point carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of the native rock ought to do that,&#8221;
he demurred. &#8220;This is a poor piece of steel,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is one of the four cutters we have been
using ever since we began. Three of them have
gone that way, and the fourth is mulling in the
hole now with only a few more minutes to live.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer. I can&#8217;t imagine what you&#8217;ve
hit that would dub the points like this. Let me
see the stuff you&#8217;ve been taking out with the
sand pump.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little heap of finely powdered cuttings
was exhibited. Wilmerding examined them with
the eye of an expert, rubbing some of the cuttings
between his thumb and finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pebbles,&#8221; he said definitely; &#8220;white quartz
pebbles embedded in the sandstone&mdash;&#8216;pudding,&#8217;
the miners call it. You&#8217;ve hit a streak of this
conglomerate, and sometimes it is as hard as
blue blazes. Still, I have never seen any of it
that was hard enough to smash a drill like that,&#8221;
he added reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the doctor,&#8221; Carfax suggested.
&#8220;What is the needed medicine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to do but to keep on hammering
away at it,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;If you
shift your location, the probabilities are that
you would run into the same stratum again.
When you go prying into Mother Earth&#8217;s secrets,
you have to take what she sends and be thankful
it&#8217;s no worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s cup of objurgation overflowed
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means Rucker to go to Chattanooga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
with the cutter points, and more delay. We
haven&#8217;t any tool-making facilities here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess this is where I come in,&#8221; said Wilmerding,
with prompt generosity. &#8220;We have
a well-equipped plant at Whitlow, and a blacksmith
who is out of sight on drill-tempering.
Load your man and the points into your motor-car
and shoot them up to us. We&#8217;ll try to keep
you going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s ill temper vanished like the dew
on a summer morning. &#8220;You are certainly an
enemy of a hitherto unsuspected variety!&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been having a good bit of
trouble, first and last; some of it bearing all the
earmarks of design on somebody&#8217;s part. Do
you know for a while I thought you might be
inspiring it? That was before Carfax discovered
you personally, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilmerding&#8217;s laugh was good-naturedly derisive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t think so small of Consolidated
Coal as to suspect it of popping at
you with a boy&#8217;s whip!&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;By and
by, when you find your coal and meet us in the
open market, we may have to buy you or smash
you. But it will be done in the good, old-fashioned
commercial way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be there when you put up the large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
come-off-the-perch bluff,&#8221; Carfax thrust in gently.
&#8220;But in the meantime, somebody <i>is</i> popping at
us with the boy&#8217;s whip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&mdash;for a guess?&#8221; asked the Whitlow
superintendent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Carfax, in the same gentle tone,
&#8220;I have a thousand dollars somewhere about
my belongings that would be delighted to blow
itself against the real answer to that question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have no clue?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax smiled. &#8220;A dozen of them, more or
less. But they all have a way of coming out by
the roots when we begin to pull on them ever
so cautiously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are calling me the enemy, but that
doesn&#8217;t count until the real fight opens up,&#8221;
said Wilmerding. &#8220;If any suggestion of mine
will help while you are clawing for a foothold....
By the way, that reminds me: I made an analysis
of your coals the other day. Thaxter didn&#8217;t have
one, didn&#8217;t seem to know anything definite
about the Ocoee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried Tregarvon. &#8220;Do you agree
with Captain Duncan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your two veins are not one and the same,
they ought to be. I couldn&#8217;t sift out the slightest
difference between the two specimens.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>There was some further talk about the characteristics,
analytical and otherwise, of the Ocoee
coal, and Wilmerding stayed long enough to see
the fourth and last drill point withdrawn from
the hole. The cutter, like its predecessors, was
a mechanical ruin; and Wilmerding again made
the proffer of the Whitlow repair-plant. Tregarvon
promised to send Rucker and the burrs up
from Coalville in the morning, and the young
superintendent climbed upon his nag and rode
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tools up, men!&#8221; Tregarvon called to the
drilling squad, when Wilmerding had disappeared
among the trees. &#8220;We&#8217;ll call it a day;
and to-morrow you may all go on the track-repairing
with Tryon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rucker was busying himself about the machinery
after the laborers had gone, and as yet
he had said nothing about wishing to be relieved
from the night-watching. But it was clear
that a man who put in full time during the day
could scarcely be expected to sleep with one eye
open at night. Moreover, if Rucker were to
start in the morning for Whitlow with the drills,
it would be necessary for him to sleep at Coalville.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your programme for to-night?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
asked Carfax, as he walked with Tregarvon to
the tool-house. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll send Rucker
down for the early start to Whitlow. You&#8217;ll
hardly care to leave things up here without a
watchman, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at the present stage of the game,&#8221; was
the prompt reply. &#8220;You may go down in the
car with Rucker, and I&#8217;ll stay here for the night.
I&#8217;d like to see some of these queer happenings for
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can beat that plan,&#8221; Carfax put in. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
forgotten that we have an invitation to Highmount
for dinner this evening. Mrs. Caswell
gave it, and I accepted for both of us. We&#8217;ll go
down and dress, and come back in the car, leaving
Rucker to stand watch here while we do the
social act. Later, Rucker can come for us, trundling
us over here, first, and himself and the drills
to Coalville afterward. How will that answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon demurred upon two counts. &#8220;You
mean that you&#8217;ll sit up with me? You don&#8217;t
have to play night-watchman to this sick project
of mine, Poictiers. Besides, I don&#8217;t care to go
to the Highmount faculty dinner. More than
that, you ought to be the last man in the world
to put me in for it. I&#8217;ve already wasted too
much time in that way, and you know it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;In the present instance I&#8217;ve promised for
you, and I guess you&#8217;ll have to go,&#8221; said Carfax
quietly. &#8220;And as for my sitting up with
you afterward, that&#8217;s a part of the game. I&#8217;m
immensely interested in skulls and things.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus, without further argument, it was
decided.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII<br />


<small>The Burnt Child</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE dinner in the president&#8217;s dining-room at
Highmount College was anything but formal.
By this time the two young men from the
North were on a footing which lacked little of
the household relation, Mrs. Caswell having said
hospitably, more than once, that their plates
were always laid at the faculty table.</p>

<p>Quite naturally, the Ocoee experiment came
in for a share of the table-talk, and in this field
Tregarvon let Carfax do most of the ploughing.
For one reason, Miss Richardia had changed
her place and was sitting on the other side of
the golden one; and for another, his own companion
was the French teacher, who persisted
in talking, and making him talk, of things trans-atlantic
and Parisian.</p>

<p>Later, however, he was tempted&mdash;and fell.
The night was too cool for the veranda, and the
after-dinner dispersal was to the music-room.
Richardia played, and for a time Tregarvon sat
beside Miss Farron and said &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;No,&#8221;
as the occasion demanded, coming always afterward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
to a rapt and regretful contemplation of
the pearl of great price on the piano-bench.</p>

<p>Being an artist to her finger-tips, Miss Birrell
at the piano became a breaker of hearts by just
so much more as the mask of self-consciousness
fell away, leaving the true art soul free to express
itself in the musician&#8217;s ecstasy of detachment.
In such moments Tregarvon saw her as
the embodied spirit of all that was most desirable
in the world of women; gazed spellbound, sinned,
repented, and sinned again; calling himself hard
names in one breath, and rhapsodizing deliriously
over the supernal charm of her in the next.</p>

<p>Again and again he told himself in caustic
self-derision that his infatuation was merely the
result of propinquity&mdash;the nearness of Richardia
coupled with the remoteness of Elizabeth. But
as often as he pleaded this excuse, the merciless
inner and final court of appeals assured him that
the evasion was but the adding of self-deception
to unfaithfulness, and insisted upon a restatement
of the humiliating facts: that he had promised
to marry a woman whom he did not love,
when he knew he did not love her; and that he
was now adding to this baseness by admitting
his love for another.</p>

<p>This restatement of the case was dinning itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
into his ears for the hundredth time while
he was saying &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;No&#8221; to the pretty
assistant in mathematics, and praying in his
more lucid intervals that Rucker might come
early with the motor-car and so forestall any
chance of deeper mirings. But Rucker was apparently
in no hurry. Miss Richardia played
until she was tired; Madame Fortier and Miss
Farron excused themselves and went to their
duties in the dormitories; Hartridge and Miss
Longstreet went to brave the chill of the evening
in a pacing constitutional on the veranda; and
the group in the music-room was cut down to
the Caswells, their guests, and Miss Birrell.</p>

<p>At this conjuncture Tregarvon saw that Carfax
was about to add insult to injury by leaving
him alone with Richardia. The president was
talking about some improvements he wished to
make in the school gymnasium: would Mr.
Carfax be good enough to look the plans over
and give a country schoolmaster the benefit of
his advice? Tregarvon turned to the nearest
window to watch for the headlamps of the expected
auto. They were not yet in sight; and
when the silence behind him gave token that
Carfax and the Caswells had gone, he knew that
he had been basely deserted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Miss Richardia was still at the piano, letting
her fingers run in delicate little harmonies up and
down the keyboard. Tregarvon meant to keep
his distance, but she drew him so irresistibly
that he was beside her before he realized that
he was once more breaking all the good resolutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go just yet,&#8221; he pleaded, when she
looked around, saw that the others were gone,
and made as if she would rise. Then he added:
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t my fault this time: I didn&#8217;t wish to
come, but Poictiers had accepted for me. You
mustn&#8217;t punish me when I don&#8217;t deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him with the air of detachment
which he had always found more trying
than her sharpest accusations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I punish you at all? Hasn&#8217;t
your conscience been doing that much for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; he begged again. &#8220;Now that it is
all over, I am going to tell you that I have been
a liar and a hypocrite.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped him with a quick little gesture of
dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t spoil it all now&mdash;just because
we happen to be alone together for a minute or
two. When are you going home to marry Miss
Wardwell?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;You are perfectly merciless,&#8221; he complained.
&#8220;Must we talk about Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask your conscience,&#8221; she retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;My conscience is busy and doesn&#8217;t want to
be disturbed. One would think you had been
born and bred in New England!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t; I was born on this mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down in the nearest chair and tried to
remember that he was talking to the woman who
was as good as promised to Poictiers Carfax.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he offered; &#8220;in a rambling old
house with a groved lawn. It has a box-bordered
carriage drive, and a big, pillared veranda fronting
the west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; when have you ever seen Westwood
House?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I haven&#8217;t seen it; perhaps I am only
imagining how it ought to look. But the name
&#8216;Westwood&#8217; is familiar enough. It is written all
over the Ocoee maps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her smile, on any other lips, would have had
more than a hint of bitterness in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we ought to be proud of the distinction.
The printing of the home name on the
maps was the only return my father ever had
for what he did for Mr. Parker. But, of course,
you know all about that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;Not so much as I&#8217;d like to know. I have
understood that your father was a heavy investor
in the original Ocoee company, and that Parker
contrived to give him the hot end of things in
the reorganization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes me feel as if I had been caught
stealing sheep,&#8221; he volunteered. &#8220;Ethically, I
suppose the Ocoee doesn&#8217;t belong to me at all,
though I hope it is clear to everybody that neither
I nor my father had any part in the crookedness.
So far as that goes, my father never knew anything
about the early history of the mine; and
neither did I before I came down here. How does
your father feel about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not strike him at the moment as being
particularly significant that she did not answer
the question categorically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those things are all past and gone,&#8221; she
said half-absently. And then: &#8220;I wish you
might meet my father; you and Mr. Carfax.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mention of Carfax&#8217;s name was as salt to
a fresh wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed your mind about Poictiers,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; he said, and he tried to make the
saying of it entirely judicial. &#8220;You made fun
of him at first, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Not of him, but of some of the things that
he said and did,&#8221; she corrected quickly. &#8220;And
that was only because I didn&#8217;t know him; because
I was so stupid as not to recognize the
real man under the transparent little mask of
affectation that he delights in holding up between
himself and all the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon made a loud call upon his magnanimity,
and concurred heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the finest there is, Richardia. I&mdash;I
hope he will be able to make you as happy as
you deserve to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment he was puzzled. Sheer maiden
modesty might have accounted for the blush, but
why should the slate-blue eyes grow suspiciously
bright, as with tears?</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he has told you?&#8221; She had turned
away from him and there was a little catch in
her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It broke my heart, Richardia&mdash;which
shows you how far I had gone on the road to depravity.
Poictiers said to me once that I was
playing the dog in the manger, and so I was.
There was no excuse, of course; there never is
an excuse for dishonor. But you were heart and
soul and conscience to me, and I seemed to need
you so much more than anybody else ever could.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
I can say all this without blame now, can&#8217;t I?
You are going to marry Poictiers, and I am going
to marry Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had turned farther away, as if to conceal
emotions too profound to be shared. At first
he thought she was crying, and wondered why.
Then it was borne in upon him that she was
laughing, and he became instantly and hotly resentful.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are laughing at me and my little lunacy,
it is all right,&#8221; he exploded. &#8220;But if it&#8217;s at
Poictiers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>When she let him see her face again it was
perfectly straight, but there were twin imps of
mockery dancing in the eyes of desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between you and Mr. Carfax it is hard for
a poor country mouse to find breathing space,&#8221;
she asserted. &#8220;Am I to understand that you
are trying to congratulate me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon frowned heavily. &#8220;No; Poictiers
is the one to be congratulated&mdash;if you were not
laughing at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; she denied promptly. &#8220;He is much
too splendid to be laughed at. Don&#8217;t criticise
the word; it is the only one that fits him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you were laughing at me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;At what I said, then? that is just as cruel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you insist upon being so quarrelsome?
I was laughing because I couldn&#8217;t help
it. Let us talk about something else; about your
mine. Have you been having any more of the
mysterious trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it is one thing after another. You
heard what Poictiers was telling at the table
this evening. He made it sound like hard luck,
but it isn&#8217;t luck; it&#8217;s design. Some one is making
the trouble for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would do such a thing as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a long time we were totally in the dark.
But now we know the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Richardia had the translucent complexion
that harmonizes perfectly with cloudy
blue eyes and masses of light-brown hair brightened
by touches of warmer tints; hence there
was no telltale pink to vanish at the command
of sudden emotion. Yet Tregarvon saw she was
startled, and that the exciting cause was quick-springing
anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen him?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rucker, the machinist, has.&#8221; Tregarvon was
always making good resolutions about not talking
too much, and always breaking them. It
had been no part of his intention to refer to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
incriminating incident in which Richardia herself
figured as one of the two actors, but the inexpedient
thing was said and he could only hope
that Richardia would not ask for more.</p>

<p>She was looking away again when she said:
&#8220;Now that you know, I suppose you will defend
your rights?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take legal steps, you mean? I don&#8217;t wish
to do that, if it can be avoided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; anything but that!&#8221; she pleaded in low
tones. &#8220;You must remember the provocation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t give the provocation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but you are associated, in a way, with
those who did. You have inherited a legacy of
ill will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might be able to understand that, if the
man who is making the trouble were one of the
ignorant natives. But he is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she agreed half-absently; &#8220;he is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you know who it is?&#8221; said Tregarvon,
again permitting himself to say one of the things
which might better have been left unsaid.</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. &#8220;I&mdash;I am afraid I do.
And I am going to plead for him, if you will let
me. There are mitigating circumstances&mdash;prejudices
against all Northerners <i>as</i> Northerners.
You can&#8217;t understand that, because the North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
didn&#8217;t suffer as the South did in the war between
the States&mdash;at least, not in the same way. And
the South has suffered bitterly since the war;
from such men as Mr. Parker. There was a disposition
on our part to let bygones be bygones,
after the great struggle; but a few unprincipled
promoters have done much to keep the old sectional
animosities alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was regarding her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wise beyond your years and your
sex,&#8221; he said soberly. &#8220;What do you think I
ought to do to this anachronistic gentleman who
is visiting the sins of other people upon my poor
head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only beg of you to be broad-minded
and charitable and slow to anger for the sake of
all concerned&mdash;for my sake, if you must put it
upon narrower ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this appeal, the earnestness of which could
not be questioned, Tregarvon was frankly puzzled.
A little earlier in the adventure he would
not have been surprised to find Richardia Birrell
pleading for Hartridge; but now, with Carfax
apparently elbowing the professor aside in
the sentimental field, there seemed to be less
reason for the plea, unless pure friendship might
account for it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;I shall put it wholly upon &#8216;narrower ground,&#8217;
as you call it,&#8221; he maintained. &#8220;If you tell me
that you care enough for the man you are
pleading for to ask me to spare him for your
sake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Care enough?&#8221; she exclaimed, wide-eyed. &#8220;I
should be singularly inhuman if I didn&#8217;t care!&#8221;</p>

<p>As in a flash of revealing lightning Tregarvon
saw and thought he understood. It was not
Hartridge for whom she was interceding; the
professor of mathematics was not the man who
had driven with her to the glade on the night
of strange happenings&mdash;who had stood with her
in the shadow of the drill derrick, shaking his
fist at the inanimate symbol of the renewed
Ocoee activities. The moving spirit in all the
enmities and antagonisms was her father!</p>

<p>For a moment the thing seemed unbelievable.
That a man who had formerly been a judge and
a champion of the law should become a feudist,
carrying his vindictiveness over from those who
had defrauded him to the defrauders&#8217; innocent
successor, appeared blankly incredible. Yet Tregarvon
remembered that the South still held many
archaic well-springs of thought and action&mdash;he
had to fight anachronisms daily in his laborers&mdash;and
that the older generation was not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
judged by the standards of the new. Judge Birrell
had felt the heel of the invader, not only
in the great conflict between the States, but
afterward, when the invader came as a friend
and robbed him in the name of business.</p>

<p>Tregarvon had little time in which to determine
what he ought to say; time for nothing but
a sudden and loyal resolve not to fail Richardia
in her moment of need. Voices in the hall warned
him that Carfax and the Caswells were returning,
and at the same moment he heard the honk
of the motor announcing Rucker&#8217;s approach. He
was upon his feet when he said: &#8220;You have told
me something that I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;didn&#8217;t suspect.
I can scarcely believe it yet. But you
need have no fears for anything that I shall do.
You mustn&#8217;t worry for a single moment. It will
all come out right in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had his reward in a quick little grasp of the
hand, in eyes filling this time with real tears, and
in a low-toned outpouring of gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would say that,&#8221; she avouched.
&#8220;It is what you have taught me to expect of
you. I am doing all I can to&mdash;to bring about a
better understanding, and if you will only be
patient and wait a little while&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax and the two Caswells were entering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
music-room, and Tregarvon turned quickly and
made a pretense of rearranging the music on the
piano desk. The small diversion gave him a
chance for another whispered word of assurance.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been advertising myself to you as all kinds
of a graceless wretch, but now I&#8217;ll show you
that I can rise to the occasion. Don&#8217;t be afraid:
there will be no scandal&mdash;no tragedy, so far as
you and yours are concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught instantly at the qualification.
&#8220;Then there are others?&#8221; she queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;One other, at least. And after what you have
just told me I am quite sure he is acting entirely
upon his own responsibility. I&#8217;ll tell you more
about him some other time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was already taking leave, and Tregarvon
joined him. The host and hostess went no
farther than the door with the departing guests,
and Miss Richardia remained in the music-room.
At the veranda steps there was a little delay
while Rucker was doing something to the motor.
In the waiting interval Tregarvon found himself
answering a question of Hartridge&#8217;s about the
progress of the test-drilling, the professor having
outstayed his art-teacher companion in their retreat
to the open air.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tregarvon, &#8220;we are not getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
along as well as we might. There seems to be
a curious obstructive fatality dogging us. If
you were in the chair of psychology instead of
that of mathematics, we might give you a very
handsome little problem to work on, Mr. Hartridge.
I wonder if you would attack it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mild-eyed professor&#8217;s smile was blandly
incommunicative.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t expect any sympathy from
me,&#8221; he returned genially. &#8220;The proverb tells
us specifically that the burnt child dreads the
fire; but it doesn&#8217;t add the corollary, which is
equally true, and as old as human nature&mdash;namely,
that the burnt child experiences an unholy
joy when his playmate attempts to pick
up the same hot nail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah?&#8221; said Tregarvon. And then: &#8220;I had
forgotten, if, indeed, I ever knew. You were
one of the original stockholders in the Ocoee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the extent of my entire savings account;
which was a mere drop in the promoter&#8217;s bucket,
after all. Nevertheless, I can still be magnanimous
enough to wish you all success.&#8221; Then,
abruptly: &#8220;You have a delightful night for your
drive to Coalville. I could almost envy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon did not undeceive him about the
destination of the drive; for good and sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
reasons it did not seem necessary to tell Hartridge
that the drilling plant would have two
watchers that night, instead of none. With a
word of leave-taking he joined Carfax in the
tonneau seat, and the yellow car rolled away
down the drive, with Rucker at the wheel.</p>

<p>It was less than an eighth of a mile from the
college gates to the point where the glade road
turned to the left out of the downward pike,
and when Rucker would have taken the left-hand
road, Tregarvon made him stop the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can walk in from here, Billy,&#8221; he explained,
and the two volunteer watchers got out
to do it while the car, lightened of two-thirds
of its load, coasted noiselessly on down the steep
mountain road and out of sight around the
first curve.</p>

<p>On the short walk over to the drilling plant
Tregarvon spoke but once, and that was to say:
&#8220;Your guess about Hartridge was right, Poictiers.
He was one of the native crowd which
was pinched out in the first reorganization of the
Ocoee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Richardia tell you that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he told me himself, just as we were
leaving. And he is still sore about it, though he
tried to turn it off as a joke.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;Um,&#8221; said Carfax reflectively. &#8220;If he is the
man who is putting a finger into your pie, we&#8217;ll
be likely to see him within the next half-hour
or so, don&#8217;t you think? He supposes we are on
the road to Coalville, and he knows that Rucker
is driving. Which presumably leaves the plant
unguarded. What will you do if we should happen
to catch him red-handed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen,&#8221; said Tregarvon
moodily. &#8220;We&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we come
to it.&#8221; And for the remainder of the walk he
was silent; it being no part of his intention to
tell Carfax that Richardia&#8217;s father was the one
who, arguing from conclusions which seemed to
be well-founded in inference, if not in fact, was
most likely to be caught red-handed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV<br />


<small>The Logic of Fact</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">UPON their arrival at the drilling plant the
two young men who had been Mrs. Caswell&#8217;s
dinner-guests made a dressing-room of the
small tool shanty and changed quickly to their
working clothes; after which they sat upon the
door-step to smoke in sober silence, each busy
with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>For Tregarvon the talk with Richardia had
wrenched the point of view violently aside, adding
new perplexities and fresh discouragement.
Richardia&#8217;s apparent fear that her father was
responsible for the obstacles which had been
thrown in the way of the test-drilling was a thing
to be believed only because Richardia&#8217;s plea could
apparently have no other meaning. Being alien
to the South and a townlander, the Philadelphian
found it difficult to understand the attitude of a
man who would make a personal matter of an
ancient business defeat, carrying his animosity
over from the real offender to an innocent third
party. But seemingly&mdash;since Richardia&#8217;s word
was not to be doubted&mdash;the fact remained.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Tregarvon saw at once that the Ocoee experiment
was made vastly less hopeful by the discovery
to which Richardia had led him. Though
he had never met Judge Birrell, Coalville gossip
had done the fiery old recluse ample justice.
For the loungers at Tait&#8217;s store the judge figured
as a venerable survival of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>; of
the good old times when the great landed proprietors
ruled their small kingdoms with an iron
rod; and were coincidentally and in the meliorating
sense of the word, kindly and generous tyrants
to all and sundry. Tregarvon had heard enough
to assure him that the sentiment of the entire
countryside would be with Judge Birrell in any
cause he might see fit to champion; but apart
from this, the one insurmountable bar to any
defensive reprisals on his own part lay in Richardia&#8217;s
appeal. Tregarvon felt that the appeal,
and his yielding thereto, had effectually tied his
hands, and he was still sufficiently infatuated to
be glad. Carfax might marry Richardia and endow
her with his millions; but her greatest debt
would still be to the man who had refused to
defend himself at her father&#8217;s expense.</p>

<p>Back of the dismaying discovery which had
changed the point of view, there was other food
for reflection. When he had ventured to hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
that Carfax might make her happy, why had
Richardia laughed? The query led to the recognition
of another impression, given often when he
was with her, and as often slurred over and dismissed
when it came to be analyzed. Not the
least of her charms for him was her crystal-clear
straightforwardness. Nevertheless, there had been
times when he had been made to feel that behind
the frankness there were reservations; times
when he had been given fleeting glimpses of an
inner Richardia hiding behind the slate-blue eyes
and whimsically mocking him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the good Mrs. Caswell&#8217;s dinner is not
disagreeing with you,&#8221; Carfax broke in, in the
midst of the analyzing abstraction; and Tregarvon
came back to things present with a jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he denied. &#8220;I was just thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not think too much after a hearty
meal. It&#8217;s bad for the digestion,&#8221; was the gentle
rejoinder.</p>

<p>Tregarvon grunted. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t leave out
anything but the name. I can&#8217;t help thinking
of her, Poictiers. It&#8217;s no disloyalty to you, or
to Elizabeth. You had no business to leave me
alone with her when Doctor Caswell asked you
to go and look over the gymnasium things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax chuckled softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;You are a wild ass of the plains, Vance. It
is borne in upon me that I shall have to marry
her out of hand to bring you to your senses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The quicker the better,&#8221; said Tregarvon
gloomily. &#8220;There is no use in prolonging the
agony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll admit that it is an agony?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t joke about it, Poictiers. I have made
the one crowning blunder that spoils a man&#8217;s
life. Don&#8217;t look at me that way. I&#8217;m not going
to be either a fool or a scoundrel. I shall marry
Elizabeth and try to make her as happy as I
can; but it will be without prejudice to the fact
that I didn&#8217;t know what love was when I promised
her. I can imagine just how brutal that sounds
to you, but it&#8217;s the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The truth is always rather brutal, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Then the golden youth permitted himself a word
that he rarely used. &#8220;I&#8217;m damned sorry for
Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I told you once before, you needn&#8217;t be,&#8221;
Tregarvon snapped back. &#8220;There is absolutely
no question of sentiment between us, and there
has never been. You&#8217;d appreciate that if you
should read her letters to me; letters in answer
to my babblings about Richardia. If Elizabeth
had a spark of sentiment in her she would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
sent me packing long ago. I&#8217;ve told her pretty
nearly everything there was to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have. That is one of your
amiable weaknesses&mdash;to tell some woman, any
woman who happens to be within reach, a lot of
things that no woman ought to be told. You
deserve all that is coming to you, Vance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I do,&#8221; Tregarvon admitted; and
beyond this the silence came to its own again.
After a time, Carfax suggested quizzically that
the ghosts might be too bashful to come out
while there were two able-bodied watchers in
sight; and at that they went inside to find seats
on a coil of rope opposite the open door. Before
long, the interior darkness began to make Tregarvon
sleepy and he had quite lost himself
when a touch of Carfax&#8217;s hand aroused him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look steadily at the big oak just beyond the
engine&mdash;the one where we found the tripod
marks,&#8221; was the whispered injunction. &#8220;Do
you see anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon rubbed the sleep out of his eyes
and stared hard at the oak. &#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is,&#8221; Carfax asserted. &#8220;There is
a man behind that tree. I saw him just before
I shook you awake.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;Piffle!&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;That oak isn&#8217;t
big enough to hide a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same, he is there!&#8221; retorted Carfax,
still in a whisper. Then: &#8220;I suppose it didn&#8217;t occur
to you that we might need something more
persuasive than our bare hands up here to-night,
did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and we shan&#8217;t.&#8221; Tregarvon was suddenly
reminded of his promise to Richardia that
there should be no tragedies. &#8220;What we can&#8217;t
handle peaceably, we&#8217;ll let go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; you&#8217;re the doctor,&#8221; said the golden
youth mildly. &#8220;Nevertheless, if I had a gun I&#8217;d
go out and capture that fellow who is hiding behind
the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still nervous, are you?&#8221; Tregarvon put in.
&#8220;You are dreaming, Poictiers. There isn&#8217;t any
one there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, again,&#8221; was the serene reply.
&#8220;Have it that way, if you like. Only don&#8217;t forget
to keep your eye on the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a patient watch
which was maintained for a full quarter of an
hour. The night was perfectly still; there was
not wind enough to rustle the browning leaves
of the oaks or to whisper in the pines. Afar off,
the little screech-owl whose haunts had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
invaded by the drilling plant lifted up his voice
in shrill chatterings, but there were no other
sounds to break the silence. Once during the
watchful vigil Tregarvon thought he saw something
stirring among the trees on the farther
side of the glade, and his fingers closed upon
Carfax&#8217;s arm. But when he looked again the
shadows were undisturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is tremendously exciting,&#8221; Carfax commented
finally, in gentle irony. &#8220;If I weren&#8217;t
morally certain that I saw a man dodge behind
that tree a little while ago, I&#8217;d fall asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do it anyway,&#8221; Tregarvon suggested. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
stand watch, and call you when your turn comes.
Take Rucker&#8217;s cot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I do. Turn in and take your forty winks.
If anything seems likely to happen, I&#8217;ll let you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I believe I&#8217;ll take you at your word.
I haven&#8217;t been so sleepy since the year before
Noah built the ark of gopherwood. If Mrs.
Caswell wasn&#8217;t as far above suspicion as the
angels of light, I might suspect her of having
put something into the black coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later Tregarvon was sitting
alone on the rope coil, rubbing his eyes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
wishing that he might decently follow Carfax&#8217;s
example. The very act of staring at the moonlit
glade hypnotized him, the more since there
was nothing unusual to be seen. With the view
through the open door becoming hazy and startlingly
distinct by turns, he struggled manfully
against the rising tide of somnolence, nodding,
and recovering himself with a jerk when he
realized that the tide was submerging him. But
out of one of the nodding moments he came
with a violent start that instantly banished all
thoughts of sleep. The little screech-owl had
ceased complaining, and the arousing sound had
been the distinct clink of metal upon stone.</p>

<p>When he looked he saw that the time for action
had come. Standing fairly in the midst of
the small clearing, the drill derrick was struck
out boldly in the white moonlight, with every
outline and detail sharply distinguishable. In
the square of cleaned rock surface marked off
by the four legs of the derrick frame Tregarvon
saw a man crouching. The clinking noise was
repeated and the watcher at the door faced about
and felt his way in the inner darkness to the bed
in the corner of the tool-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Poictiers!&#8221; he called in low tones;
&#8220;the play has begun!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Carfax sat up promptly and asked but a moment
for the finding of himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m all here,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer Tregarvon led him to the door and
pointed to the square of bared bed-rock under
the derrick frame. There was a man there, without
doubt, but now he was standing up and was
apparently examining something which lay in the
palm of his hand. The sudden rush of the two
from the tool shanty was quite evidently a surprise
for the intruder, but he made no attempt
to escape. So far from it, he lifted his soft hat
politely and said: &#8220;Good evening again, gentlemen.
You took me completely by surprise&mdash;as
perhaps you meant to. I was quite sure that
you were both safely in bed in Coalville by this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Carfax very gently. &#8220;We have
not been in Coalville at all: we have been here,
waiting, quite patiently for&mdash;you, Mr. Hartridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was kind,&#8221; said Hartridge affably.
&#8220;And, now that your patient waiting has been
duly rewarded?&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that we have caught you we shall ask
you to solve that little problem in psychology
for us,&#8221; put in Tregarvon. &#8220;We&#8217;d like to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
what it is that you have just been dropping into
that drill-hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I assure you that I have been putting
nothing into your drill-hole, what then, Mr.
Tregarvon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case I shall ask Carfax to see that
you don&#8217;t run away while I ascertain for myself,&#8221;
was the firm rejoinder; and a careful dip of
the long cleaning spoon into the test-hole brought
up a half-dozen small metallic objects; cubes cut
from a bar of tool-steel they appeared to be.</p>

<p>Tregarvon handled the cubes and passed them
on to Carfax.</p>

<p>&#8220;We owe you something for a day lost and
four drill points all but ruined, Mr. Hartridge,&#8221;
he said rather grimly, adding: &#8220;But we&#8217;ll credit
your account with this present failure to make
us do it all over again to-morrow. Would you
mind telling us in so many words what your object
has been&mdash;or still is, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor&#8217;s smile was imperturbably bland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you wouldn&#8217;t be so harsh as to put
me on the witness-stand in my own defense,&#8221; he
said, still amiable. &#8220;Especially since you have
no evidence of anything worse than a neighborly
call at, perhaps, a somewhat unseasonable hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this Carfax came quite close and he forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
to lisp when he said: &#8220;Mr. Hartridge, may I
ask you to remove your overcoat for a moment?
The night is a bit chilly, I know, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone of the request was gentle enough but
there was a quality in it that made the suggestion
a demand. The professor slipped out of the
coat, quaintly quoting Scripture for the ready
compliance. &#8220;&#8216;If any man ... take away thy
coat, let him have thy cloak, also.&#8217; Anything
to oblige a friend, Mr. Carfax.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax took the surrendered coat and, feeling
in the right-hand pocket, drew out one of the
little steel cubes; quite evidently the one which
Hartridge had had in his hand at the moment
of surprises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; that is all,&#8221; said the searcher,
returning the coat, or rather holding it thoughtfully
while Hartridge put it on. And then:
&#8220;You will hardly deny that we have sufficient
evidence now, I take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor of mathematics spread his hands
as one who has done his best and is only regretful
that he can do no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us assume that the case has gone to the
jury: what is the verdict, gentlemen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are asking what we mean to do?&#8221; Tregarvon
demanded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;That is it, precisely. What can you do?&mdash;drag
me before the nearest justice of the peace
on a charge of malicious mischief? You would
scarcely wish to disturb the tranquillity of an old
and honored institution of learning like Highmount
College by such a proceeding as that,
would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon could not help smiling at the audacity
of the man, and the New Yorker laughed
outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a most excellent quality of nerve,
Mr. Hartridge,&#8221; was Carfax&#8217;s tribute to the
audacity. &#8220;As you suggest, our field is rather
limited. You are perfectly well aware of the
fact that Highmount and its hospitality stand
as the only barrier between us and social starvation.
Let us try to discover a <i>modus vivendi</i>.
The verdict is: &#8216;Guilty, with a recommendation
to mercy.&#8217; We are willing to give any man&#8217;s
sense of humor a chance to redeem itself. You
quoted Scripture at me a moment ago, let me
return the compliment: &#8216;Go in peace, and sin
no more.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor drew himself up, smiling genially
and lifting his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, gentlemen; you are very considerate,&#8221;
he returned in gentle irony. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
which he walked away, pausing at the edge of
the glade to lift his hat again.</p>

<p>Carfax drew a long breath when the tall, black-coated
figure was lost under the tree shadows.
Then he turned upon his companion:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to say, &#8216;I told you so,&#8217; Vance,
because I think you came around to my point
of view some little time ago. What is the motive&mdash;Hartridge&#8217;s
motive? Is it merely impish
humor? Or does it go deeper than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was busily engaged in putting two
and two together to make the inevitable four.
The schoolmaster was in love with Richardia
Birrell; the Philadelphian&#8217;s first visit to Highmount
had made this perfectly plain: could it
be possible that Hartridge was acting as Judge
Birrell&#8217;s agent in the obstacle-raising? And, if
so, did Richardia know it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay here a few minutes, Poictiers,&#8221; he directed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to follow him and see if he
goes straight back to Highmount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joy go with you,&#8221; said Carfax; and when he
was left alone he went to sit on the step of the
tool-house to smoke while he waited.</p>

<small>Mammy Ann&#8217;s Grave</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CARFAX was smoking his third cigarette
when Tregarvon returned from spying upon
the retreating professor and sat down in sober
silence upon the door-step.</p>

<p>The smoker waited patiently for some little
time before he said suggestively: &#8220;I hope you
didn&#8217;t have your walk for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw all I needed to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hartridge went to the college?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so; he was headed that way when
I turned back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax waited again, and when nothing further
was forthcoming: &#8220;It&#8217;s a remarkably beautiful
night, isn&#8217;t it? Did you ever see a handsomer
moon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me talk!&#8221; was the irritable rejoinder.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sorry for it if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try me and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then&mdash;if you will have it: there was a
witness to our little comedy out there under the
derrick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one who came with Hartridge?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;I guess so. Some one who went back with
him, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to tell you, Poictiers. It was&mdash;it was
the woman you are going to marry; Richardia
Birrell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you need be so desperately
gloomy because it happened to be Richardia.
As I remarked a moment ago, the night is jewel
fine, and I don&#8217;t wonder that she found it hard
to stay indoors. And as to my rights in the
matter, I am far from denying her the privilege
of walking abroad with so old a friend as Mr.
William W. Hartridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying to make a jest of it, as you
do of everything,&#8221; was the crabbed retort. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see what it means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must confess that I don&#8217;t see anything especially
catastrophic about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t? Why, good heavens, man!
it means that Richardia knows what Hartridge
has been doing. I won&#8217;t admit yet that she is
a party to it; but she <i>knows</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Place aux dames</i>,&#8221; said Carfax cheerfully.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll give her the benefit of the doubt; it&#8217;s
our clear duty&mdash;or, at least, it is mine.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll be hanged if we do!&#8221; Tregarvon
growled. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t even a doubt where she
is concerned!&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax threw the half-burnt cigarette away and
lighted another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tone is that of the still deeply infatuated
lover. Must we again come back to that phase
of it?&#8221; he inquired, in the tone of the long-suffering
but still amiable bystander.</p>

<p>The man beside him took plenty of time to
consider. But when he opened the flood-gates
there was a torrent of self-accusings to pour
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a beast, a cad, the cheapest of cheap
skates, Poictiers!&mdash;anything you like to call me.
It hasn&#8217;t touched Richardia, but it has gone all
sorts of despicable distances with me. When you
told me the other night that you had proposed
to her, I could have murdered you. And just
now, when I saw her walking arm in arm with
Hartridge, I wanted to run amuck and destroy
him. I&#8217;m not trying to excuse myself when I
say that I didn&#8217;t go down without a struggle.
I did make some kind of a fight at first: I even
went so far as to tell Richardia all about Elizabeth.
But it didn&#8217;t do any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s smile was out of the depths of wisdom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and it was not visible above the horizon
for the penitent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was great,&#8221; he said, referring to the
forlorn-hope confession of the engagement. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe I could have done that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there is nothing coming to me on that
score,&#8221; Tregarvon objected, carrying self-abnegation
to the limit. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help telling
her; not because it was the honest thing to do,
but because I should have burst into inconsequent
little shards long ago if I hadn&#8217;t told her
everything I knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she has been encouraging this little idiosyncrasy
of yours?&#8221; Carfax asked tentatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life! She has been doing everything
that an angel out of heaven could do to
smash me back into my place; to show me how
many different kinds of an idiot I was making
of myself. No longer ago than this evening,
when you went off with the Caswells and left me
in the lurch, the first thing she did was to ask me
when I was going home to marry Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time in Tregarvon&#8217;s knowing of
him, Carfax appeared to be losing his temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A beast, a cad, and the cheapest of cheap
skates,&#8217;&#8221; he repeated carefully. &#8220;They are your
own words, and they will all apply to you if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
don&#8217;t tell Elizabeth all and more than you have
just told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the millstone grind of it!&#8221; groaned
the sinner. &#8220;If I should tell her how far it has
gone with me, it would be tantamount to asking
her to make me a present of myself, with the
Uncle Byrd millions thrown in for a <i>lagniappe</i>. I
suppose I&#8217;ve got it to do, now, but I&#8217;d cheerfully
accept the alternative of walking into old Brother
Daniel&#8217;s den of lions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-s, I should think you would,&#8221; was the
drawling comment. &#8220;Any man who would make
a football of the happiness of such a woman as
Elizabeth Wardwell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; Tregarvon cut in, sobering suddenly.
&#8220;Get up and walk on me, if that is what
you think is coming to me; but don&#8217;t mangle
me with a cold iron. I&#8217;m out of it all around.
If Richardia doesn&#8217;t marry you, she&#8217;ll marry
Hartridge; and when I tell Elizabeth, as I&#8217;ve
got to, that will be the end of things with her.
You mustn&#8217;t hit a man when he is down. It&#8217;s
wicked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything goes&mdash;between friends,&#8221; said Carfax,
who could never take the trouble to put his
displeasure into any permanent form. &#8220;It does
look as if you were up against it, before and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
behind. Far be it from me to break the bruised
reed, or to quench the smoking flax.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, confound you for a Job&#8217;s comforter!&#8221;
rasped Tregarvon, breaking out afresh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to believe in people&mdash;I&#8217;m built that way;
and if I could think for a moment that Richardia
is Hartridge&#8217;s accomplice in this contemptible
trickery of his&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you could?&#8221; prompted the comforter,
after the pause had grown overlong.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could, I&#8217;d lose faith in my own good
intentions,&#8221; finished Tregarvon, whose stock of
comparisons was running low. &#8220;Still,&#8221; he went
on, talking now because he was started and could
not stop, &#8220;still it&#8217;s against me, Poictiers; the
whole world is against me. In that same talk in
the music-room this evening&mdash;while you were
away with the Caswells&mdash;Richardia was anxious
about these happenings of ours; afraid somebody
would get hurt; in fact, she made me promise not
to hurt anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning Professor William Wilberforce Hartridge,
M.A., Vanderbilt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; er&mdash;that is, I don&#8217;t think she meant
him.&#8221; Tregarvon was not yet ready to tell Carfax
that he was well assured that her fear was for
her father; though she had not bound him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
secrecy, he felt that what she had said had been
spoken in confidence.</p>

<p>Carfax got up from his cramped sitting on the
door-step, stretched, yawned, and looked at his
watch, holding the dial up to the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten minutes past eleven,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Do we turn in and sleep a few lines? Or is it
to be a continuous performance&mdash;like those that
the vaudeville people advertise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go inside and finish your nap,&#8221; Tregarvon
directed, filling and lighting his pipe. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
sleepy now; don&#8217;t know as I ever shall be again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the curtain has been rung down
for to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d say so, wouldn&#8217;t you? The star has
gone home and has probably gone to bed. If he
should get up and walk in his sleep, I&#8217;ll call
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax hung upon the threshold. &#8220;Better call
me, anyhow, after I&#8217;ve had another forty winks
or so, so you can take your turn. People have to
sleep, you know&mdash;even after a funeral.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to bed!&#8221; was the gruff command;
and Tregarvon began a monotonous sentry beat
up and down before the tool-house. But a minute
later he thrust his face in at the little square window
to say: &#8220;Asleep yet?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;My Heavens, no!&#8221; returned a querulous voice
in the inner darkness. &#8220;Do you take me for an
auto-hypnotist?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just developed a notion, and it is beginning
to gnaw me,&#8221; explained the sentinel on
duty. &#8220;What if the man who was on his knees
at the test-hole when I went to waken you wasn&#8217;t
Hartridge, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good Lord!&#8221; complained the voice.
&#8220;Are you trying to drag somebody else into it?&mdash;when
the character cast is already full and running
over, and all the supernumeraries have been
tagged and labelled? Turn the notion out of
doors; tread on it; break its back with a stick!
We caught Hartridge with the goods on him,
didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much: only now that I come to think
of it, I seem to remember that the man I saw
dropping things into the hole wasn&#8217;t wearing
Hartridge&#8217;s kind of a hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, granny! Go on and do your little
sentry go. Your head is muddled and you want
to pass the muddle on to me. I&#8217;m asleep, I tell
you&mdash;sound asleep! I don&#8217;t hear a word you are
saying.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>Tregarvon gave it up; not the lately developed
notion, which grew rather more insistent the
longer he thought about it, but the attempt to
interest Carfax. During the lonely two-hour
watch which followed he had time to go reflectively
over the events of the night, to set them in
orderly array, and to let the unconsidered minor
happenings fit into their places and weigh as they
would.</p>

<p>The process straightened out a few of the
tangles, or it seemed to. Richardia&#8217;s concern,
expressed by her fear that violence might grow
out of the antagonisms, was undoubtedly for her
father. Also, it was plain that up to the moment
of confidences she had not suspected Hartridge of
being her father&#8217;s agent; it being a fair presumption
that she would have spoken of the professor
if she had. Having got that far, Tregarvon began
to ask himself if Hartridge was the only one
actively involved. In at least two instances the
schoolmaster might fairly be held exempt. It
was still incredible that the man who had come
to the Coalville headquarters as a guest had deliberately
plotted to have his host&#8217;s motor-car
wrecked on its return from Highmount. By the
same token, it was difficult to imagine the professor
of mathematics in the r&ocirc;le of the sardonic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
practical joker who had shocked Rucker with a
resin-filled skull, dug, doubtless, out of the old
burying-ground.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the murderous attempt at
wrecking the car and the grim joke on Rucker
fitted the mountain-baron-henchman hypothesis
most accurately; as did the fact, if it were a fact,
that there were two persons concerned in the
recent episode of the hardened steel cubes. There
had been time, during the arousing of Carfax, for
one man to disappear and for another to take his
place; in which case it seemed evident that
Hartridge had stood his ground merely to cover
the retreat of the other man.</p>

<p>The puzzle promised to give a coherent hint
pointing to its solution while Tregarvon was thinking
it out and fitting the pieces together; and so
long as the mental effort continued to feed the
fire of wakefulness he was all that an alert sentinel
should be. But after the various suppositions
had been properly labelled and docketed
and pigeonholed the physical reaction came, and
drowsiness sat upon his shoulders, riding him like
an Old Man of the Sea.</p>

<p>For a time he fought manfully, keeping up
the struggle until he had exhausted every device
he could think of and yielding only when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
found himself actually falling asleep as he walked.
The alternative to leaving the plant without a
watchman was to call Carfax, and this he finally
concluded to do. Groping his way blindly into
the dark interior of the tool-shack, he stumbled
over the spare coil of rope, sat down upon it for a
momentary rest, and in the flitting of a bat&#8217;s
wing was past help.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again the high-riding
moon had swung far into the west, the glade was
bathed in a ghostly flood of gray shadow, and
Carfax was shaking him gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another act on,&#8221; whispered the impromptu
call-boy; &#8220;no speaking parts out, as yet&mdash;only
pantomime. But it is worth sitting up to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon, still sodden with sleep, suffered Carfax
to lead him to the outlook window. In the
gray shadows he presently made out the figure of
another intruder. Within the area of the sunken
graves a man, old and black, if the uncertain
light could be trusted, was squatting on the ground
and rocking himself back and forth, his swaying
body keeping time with the measure of a
weird, crooning melody. From time to time, he
would stop the swaying movement to take a
small white object from a basket at his side.
These objects he appeared to be arranging in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
some sort of a figure on the ground to the accompaniment
of the droning incantation.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has he been there?&#8221; Tregarvon
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a little while,&#8221; was the low-toned reply.
&#8220;I awoke about half an hour ago, and when I
looked out, the moon was going over to the other
edge of the world, and everything was quiet. A
little later the basket man came; just appeared,
you know, as if he had materialized out of the
shadows. When I first noticed him he was doing
his little song and dance, as you see him now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what <i>is</i> the &#8216;song and dance,&#8217; as you call
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Write your guess on one side of a sheet of
paper and send it to the puzzle editor,&#8221; chuckled
Carfax, adding: &#8220;If we had begun doing that at
first, the editor would have a choice collection
by this time, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been making a few more guesses,&#8221;
Tregarvon offered. &#8220;I was coming in to unload
them on you when my eyes went shut. What
time is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About two o&#8217;clock&mdash;the real witching hour.
I want to go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go out and tell the old conjurer yonder; perhaps
he may have a magic square of carpet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
in his basket,&#8221; suggested Tregarvon. Then:
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the wild and weird atmosphere of this
heritage of mine get on your nerves to the queen&#8217;s
taste? Something doing all the time. I&#8217;m going
to put a notice on the derrick frame: &#8216;Don&#8217;t
shoot the stunt-setter; he is doing the best he
can.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sh! what is the old &#8216;ghost doctor&#8217; up to
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The droning chant had ceased and the old
negro was crouching or kneeling at one end of
the oblong figure traced by the enclosing row of
white objects. The silence was profound; so
complete that the snapping of a twig coming suddenly
shattered it like the report of a pistol.
Both of the watchers started at the sound, but
the kneeling negro seemed not to have heard it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; whispered Carfax.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m guessing once more: the obi-devil, possibly,
coming in answer to the old medicine-man&#8217;s
prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess again!&#8221; Carfax thrust in excitedly.
&#8220;Look this way&mdash;get a line on the corner of the
derrick frame and follow it over into the woods.
Do you see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and began to grope for
a weapon. A man, hatless and with a handkerchief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
bound about his head, was edging his way
cautiously out of the undergrowth. In the hollow
of his left arm he carried a gun, and his advance
was like that of the deer-stalking hunter.
With the derrick frame intervening it was to be
inferred that he did not see the negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody pot-hunting for us, this time?&#8221;
queried Carfax, under his breath; but Tregarvon
pressed his arm for silence. The cautious approach
was not in the direction of the tool shanty;
it was toward the engine of the drilling installation.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the fellow we want to surround,&#8221;
Tregarvon whispered. &#8220;If he had a hat on, I&#8217;d
swear he was the man I saw kneeling under the
derrick&mdash;before he made his drop-out and left
Hartridge to throw dust for him! By Jove! he
acts as if he were scared!&#8221;</p>

<p>The exclamation was not unwarranted. The
man with the gun was creeping toward the portable
engine, watchful and alert, starting at every
whisper of the night air in the pines and exhibiting
all the outward signs of an inward tension
which was ready to snap and recoil in panic.</p>

<p>When he passed out of sight behind the derrick,
Carfax would have led the charge; but Tregarvon
restrained him. &#8220;Hold on,&#8221; he advised.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
&#8220;We may as well wait and find out what he means
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was creeping on hands and knees
when he came in sight again, and the gun had
been left behind. When he stood up he was at
the smoke-stack end of the engine-boiler; and a
moment further along the two watchers made out
that he was unscrewing the fastenings of the iron
door which gave access to the smoke-box and the
flues. They waited until he had the door unfastened;
saw him swing it open by slow inchings;
saw him thrust an arm into the sooty depths of
the smoke-box.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Now!</i>&#8221; Tregarvon commanded, setting the
pace for the charge; but panic was before them.
Just as the man was withdrawing his arm a deep
groan shuddered upon the stillness. With a
cry that was like the snarl of a cornered animal,
the man leaped up and flung out his arms as if to
ward a blow. At that the huddled figure kneeling
among the sunken graves groaned again, following
the groan with a terrified, &#8220;<i>Oh</i>, my
Lordy!&#8221; when he saw the man at the boiler
head.</p>

<p>That was sufficient. At the spot where the
man with a handkerchief about his head had
stood clutching the air there was a sudden void,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
and the noise of his crashing retreat through the
undergrowth had died away before Tregarvon
and Carfax could give chase.</p>

<p>They captured the &#8220;ghost doctor,&#8221; however,
and were not greatly surprised when the old negro
turned out to be Uncle William. His night
wandering to the mountain top was sufficiently
explained when he pointed to the sunken grave
ringed about with bits of broken china.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dah&#8217;s whah my ol&#8217; &#8217;ooman is, marstehs; yas,
suh; right dah&#8217;s whah dey bury huh. Dat

nuffin&#8217; belongin&#8217; ter you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tregarvon soberly. &#8220;You may be
sure we shan&#8217;t disturb your wife&#8217;s grave&mdash;or any
of the others, if we can help it. I didn&#8217;t know,
until after we had begun work here, that this
open place was a burying-ground. Now tell me;
do you know who that man was who stood there
by the engine and made motions at you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;I &#8217;spec&#8217; dat wuz de ol&#8217; debbil, hese&#8217;f, marsteh.
Couldn&#8217;t a-been nobody else; no, suh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think it was the devil, Uncle
William?&#8221; Carfax wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause he go off, <i>bing!</i> in a puff o&#8217; yaller
smoke when I say &#8216;<i>Oh</i>, my Lordy!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon had been groping purposefully in
the old man&#8217;s explanation to determine if it held
any of the missing puzzle pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say Sam, from the &#8216;old place&#8217; told you
we were working here, Uncle William; who is
Sam, and where is the &#8216;old place&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam, he&#8217;s dat triflin&#8217; no-&#8217;count niggah what
Marsteh Judge keep for stable niggah&mdash;when
dey ain&#8217; nuffin in de stable &#8217;ceppin&#8217; de ol&#8217; dapple-gray

But de ol&#8217; Marsteh Judge ain&#8217; gwine tu&#8217;n nobody

in de gre&#8217;t house; no, suh; he ain&#8217; gwine do
dat!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this point that Tregarvon sprang his
small trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he turn you off, Uncle William?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, me? No, suh&mdash;I&mdash;Miss Dick, she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right; never mind, Uncle William,&#8221;
Tregarvon hastened to say. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll undertake
to keep the devil away while you go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
setting your tombstones. I&#8217;m sorry we had to
break in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey&#8217;s all sot, yas, suh; dat&#8217;s de bes&#8217; I kin do
for ol&#8217; Mammy Ann. I&#8217;s gwine tromp off down

t&#8217;ank yo&#8217; kin&#8217;ly, marstehs.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the old negro had shuffled away on a
short-cut through the wood in the direction of
the pike, the two young men took up the affair
of the moment, which was to ascertain what the
man with the bandaged head had been doing to
the engine of the drilling plant. The smoke-box
door was standing open, as he had left it,
and Tregarvon struck a match and held it in the
small sooty cavern. What he saw made him
withdraw the match suddenly and blow it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it bite you?&#8221; asked Carfax, genially
quizzical.</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s rejoinder was not in words.
Thrusting an arm into the smoke-box he drew
out a paper-wrapped cylinder with a capped fuse
buried in one end of it, passing the find to Carfax
with the remark: &#8220;I fancy we can stay
awake until daybreak on the strength of that,
don&#8217;t you think, Poictiers?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;Dynamite!&#8221; gasped Carfax, holding the cartridge
gingerly between thumb and finger and at
arm&#8217;s length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dynamite. It was poked into one of
the flues with the business end toward the fire-box,
and it made no account of Rucker, who
would be the one to fire up the boiler before
breakfast the day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, by Jove, Vance! this thing is getting
serious!&#8221; exclaimed the golden youth, forgetting
even the slight hint of a lisp. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to
&#8216;take measures,&#8217; as my father used to say. Come
on over to the shanty and we&#8217;ll get busy. I am
in the same condition you said you were, a while
back: I&#8217;m not sleepy now&mdash;don&#8217;t know as I
ever shall be again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The talk on the door-step of the tool-house
was prolonged far past Tregarvon&#8217;s recounting
of the suppositions pieced together in the period
of his lonely sentry go. But it came back to
the suppositions in the end, with Carfax checking
off the probabilities on his finger-tips.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it figures out about this way,&#8221; he said,
not too cheerfully. &#8220;We have Judge Birrell as
Lord High Executioner to a couple of receivers
of stolen goods&mdash;always without his daughter&#8217;s
approval or consent, as a matter of course&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
Professor Hartridge as his able deputy in the
field. Then there is this skulking rascal of a
dynamite-planter, who acts under orders, or possibly
exceeds them now and then; and he seems
to be the only one of the lot that we can satisfactorily
pinch&mdash;when we shall be lucky enough
to catch him. Uncle William isn&#8217;t in it, is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon shook his head gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been wrestling with that,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;He seems more than trustworthy.
But he is evidently an old house servant of the
judge&#8217;s, and he was sent straight to me from
Westwood. That is beyond question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a spy?&mdash;perish the thought!&#8221; ranted Carfax,
carefully concealing his earnestness with an
overlaying of extravagance, as his habit was.
&#8220;With the memory of Uncle William&#8217;s unapproachable
dinners in my mind&mdash;or mouth&mdash;I&#8217;ll
defend him to the last gasp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is negligible,&#8221; said Tregarvon briefly.
&#8220;But this dynamiting emissary of Hartridge&#8217;s,
or the judge&#8217;s, isn&#8217;t. We must contrive to trap
him in some way. If we don&#8217;t, he will fool around
until he hurts somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, verily,&#8221; Carfax laughed. &#8220;Any guesses
coming to you?&mdash;as to who he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One small one; and it wouldn&#8217;t be worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
mentioning if it didn&#8217;t fit in with some of the
others. You saw that he was bareheaded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that he was wearing a handkerchief or
a bandage of some sort instead of a hat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another &#8216;yes&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the day before yesterday the man
we&#8217;ve been calling &#8216;Morgan&#8217; was hurt by the
falling walking-beam and had to have his head
wrapped up in about the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; but Sherlock Holmes wouldn&#8217;t
stop with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do I. Tryon told me a little tale two
days ago that possibly forges the connecting
link. We know that both Morgan and Sill are
McNabbs, and that for some reason of their
own they dropped the surname when they hired
out to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Carfax approved. &#8220;The plot thickens.
Can&#8217;t you stir in a little more stiffening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the help of Tryon&#8217;s story, I can. It
seems that these men are, or have been, moonshiners&mdash;breakers
of the revenue laws. Some
years ago the revenue officers raided their secret
still, which was hidden somewhere in the Pocket,
and arrested these two, with a number of others.
Morgan McNabb and his brother were booked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
for the penitentiary; would have gone there if
Judge Birrell hadn&#8217;t come out of his retirement
and fought for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was slowly filling the short pipe he had
borrowed from his companion. &#8220;I begin to see
daylight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What was the judge&#8217;s
motive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sort of clan loyalty, Tryon says. The
McNabbs live on his land; they are &#8216;his people&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; was the thoughtful comment. &#8220;And
because the judge defends them, they take up
the cudgels for him. We have to-morrow&mdash;or
rather to-day&mdash;before us, with nothing especial
to do; since Rucker will hardly be back with
the drills before afternoon. Shall we telegraph
to Hesterville for the sheriff, borrow Tait&#8217;s team,
and make a party call upon the man with the
bandaged head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be rather too summary, wouldn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; Tregarvon objected. &#8220;We may be well
convinced, ourselves, but we have no direct
evidence. Neither of us could go on the stand
and swear that the man we saw at the boiler-head
was Morgan McNabb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that is so. Past that, since I have
asked the judge&#8217;s daughter to consider me as
a possible husband&mdash;&#8221; Carfax had called up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the cherubic smile, but it had the opposite of a
mollifying effect upon the objector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t harp on that part of it any more than
you have to,&#8221; was the morose interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to say that the arrest of Morgan
McNabb, just at this critical turn in the tide of
affairs, might make it embarrassing for the judge;
only you wouldn&#8217;t let me finish,&#8221; said Carfax,
with great meekness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to call on him?&#8221; demanded
Tregarvon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since he is Richardia&#8217;s father, I don&#8217;t see
how I can well avoid it. To-morrow&mdash;or, I
should say, to-day&mdash;is Friday, and I thought
I&#8217;d ask Richardia to let me drive her over to
Westwood House&mdash;if you&#8217;ll lend me the motor-wagon
after Rucker gets back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon rose and stood half-menacingly over
the friend of his youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought you were only playing with
her,&#8221; he grated; but instead of saying what he
would do in that case, he turned abruptly and
went into the tool-house to fling himself down
upon the cot, leaving Carfax to continue the
night-watch or to abandon it, as he might choose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI<br />


<small>A Friend at Need</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH the object-lessons of the night of
visitations to emphasize the need for
vigilance, the two young men, discussing the
situation in the gray dawn, agreed that the
drilling plant must not be left unguarded during
the Friday of enforced idleness, or at any other
time. Accordingly, soon after sunrise, Carfax
set out to walk down the mountain for the purpose
of sending Tryon and a man or two of the
track gang up to relieve Tregarvon.</p>

<p>This arrangement left the owner of the Ocoee
to do sentry duty alone until Tryon should
come&mdash;a duty which he scamped ingloriously
by sitting upon the door-step of the tool-shack
and promptly falling asleep.</p>

<p>It was a brusque &#8220;Hello!&#8221; that awakened
him, and he sprang up with a start to find a
round-faced, pursy little man in pepper-and-salt
garmentings and mouse-colored driving-gloves
standing before him. A horse and buggy
motionless in the edge of the glade accounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
for the manner of the visitor&#8217;s coming, but not
for its object. Tregarvon took a good look at
the stranger before he committed himself, even
to a greeting. The round face, with its twinkling
eyes, double chin, and the little patches of closely
cropped side-whisker, was altogether reassuring;
it not only beamed good-nature, it fairly shone
with an irresistible kindliness. Tregarvon, gathering
his scattered wits as he could, said: &#8220;Good
morning; it&#8217;s a fine morning for a drive through
the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little man added another layer of geniality
to his smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine morning, also, for a nap in the
sunshine,&#8221; he reciprocated. &#8220;Do you belong
to the out-of-door sleepers&mdash;the &#8216;simple-lifers&#8217;&mdash;Mr.
Tregarvon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not permanently,&#8221; laughed Tregarvon;
&#8220;though I must confess that I am so simple as
not to be able to recall your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, dev&#8217;lish good!&#8221; chuckled the visitor.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have turned it more neatly myself,
&#8217;pon my word! I&#8217;m Thaxter; Wilmerding&#8217;s
bookkeeper at Whitlow. One of my fads is to
take a drive before breakfast. Excellent habit,
Mr. Tregarvon; I can recommend it most highly.
Gives you an appetite like a coal-heaver. Speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
of coal&mdash;how are you getting along taking
soundings on the old Ocoee? Have you hit it
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Tregarvon admitted, warming to
the little man&#8217;s friendly interest. &#8220;But I am
still living in hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Thaxter pursed his lips in a way to make
them match the general effect of rotundity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty mean thing to say to a man before
breakfast&mdash;you haven&#8217;t breakfasted yet, I dare
say&mdash;but you are butting your head against a
stone wall, Mr. Tregarvon. Haven&#8217;t they told
you that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your &#8216;they&#8217; refers to the Coalville gossips,
I have been duly warned. They told me, with
all the variations, before I&#8217;d had time to climb
the mountain on my first exploring expedition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so; but not specifically, I suppose.
You should have come to me. While I am an
employee of the C. C. &amp; I. Company, my pay-roll
connection wouldn&#8217;t have kept me from doing
you a good turn. And I could have given you
chapter, page, and verse.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment Tregarvon lost sight of the
fact that Wilmerding had reported his bookkeeper
totally barren of Ocoee information. So
he said: &#8220;Possibly you will do it now, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Thaxter. We are mere babes in the wood, Carfax
and I, needing a guardian angel pretty severely,
if we are to believe what other people say
of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have certainly been needing a little
friendly counsel from some one who was in a
position to know what he was talking about.
You&#8217;ll never find your coal up here, Mr. Tregarvon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what they all say; but they don&#8217;t
tell us precisely why we shan&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the kindly one, shaking his head
in deprecation. &#8220;Human nature is the same
everywhere. Tait could have told you, or Tryon,
or Walters; all of them who have lived here long
enough. But you had money and were willing
to spend it. It would have been killing the
golden-egged goose to have driven you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon grinned. &#8220;Thank you for trying
to break it gently to me, Mr. Thaxter; but I am
braced for it now. Hurl it in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They could have told you that this test-boring
experiment of yours has been tried before,
all over the mountain top. I presume I could
show you a dozen holes, if they are not all filled
up with wash and hidden under the leaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was thinking hard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>&#8220;Does Captain Duncan know this?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should suppose so; he ought to know it.
The testing was done by the New Ocoee Coal
Company, and it may have timed itself during
the summer that Duncan spent in the West.
Come to think, I believe it did. You advised
with him, of course; surely he didn&#8217;t encourage
you to spend money on the property, did he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I am obliged to confess that he did not.
On the contrary, he advised me not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little man&#8217;s smile became benignantly
tolerant. &#8220;You young men are like Mr. Kipling&#8217;s
puppy at times; you <i>will</i> chew soap, knowing
perfectly well that it is soap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s answering laugh admitted the
justness of the charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly some of us like the flavor of soap,&#8221;
he retorted. &#8220;There is no accounting for the
depravity of some tastes, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said the visitor, with the air of
one who is far too wise to combat the vagaries
of youth, &#8220;go on and have your fling. It is
harmless enough. If you can afford to buy a
little amusement in this way, why shouldn&#8217;t
you do it? It won&#8217;t hurt you, and it is a Godsend
to Tait and the poor devils on your pay-roll
while it lasts.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;But if I can&#8217;t afford it?&#8221; suggested Tregarvon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah; that is another matter. From what
Wilmerding has let fall, I have been assuming
that you and Mr. Carfax desired the experience
and the fun of it rather than any possible money
gain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money side of it may not appeal to Carfax;
but it does to me, very forcibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, you are throwing good money after
bad in putting down these test-holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;What
would you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I inherited the Ocoee,
and it is up to me to make something out of it,
if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The round-bodied bookkeeper laughed until he
shook like a bowl of jelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very evident, Mr. Tregarvon, that you
were born in the purple. If you wish to make
money out of the Ocoee, why don&#8217;t you sell it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I should first have to find a purchaser,
and before I could find a purchaser&mdash;I should
think&mdash;it would be a condition precedent that I
should find the coal. It resolves itself into the
vicious circle, as you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Thaxter smote his gloved hands together
softly and appeared to be debating a nice point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
with himself. When he spoke again his manner
had lost the touch of brisk impersonality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me if I seem to crowd the mourners,&#8221;
he apologized, &#8220;but it strikes me that this is a
matter in which the good-natured bystander may
quite properly take a hand. Is it possible that
you haven&#8217;t been told of the offer made by our
people to your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is more than possible; it is a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am truly astonished! Your lawyers must
know of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has never been any mention of it made
to me. What was the offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I remember correctly, it was one hundred
thousand dollars for all the titles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; exclaimed Tregarvon triumphantly.
&#8220;That is the best news I&#8217;ve heard in
many a day. If your company ever made any
such an offer as that, it proves conclusively that
there is coal in the property, somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bookkeeper shook his round head in evident
dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear!&#8221; he lamented; &#8220;I was afraid you
might jump at some such conclusion as that, and
it puts me in a rather awkward position. As I
have said, I am only a pay-roll man in Consolidated
Coal; I&#8217;m not even one of its many superintendents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Yet, as man to man, perhaps I may
venture to tell you just why the C. C. &amp; I. might
still be willing to pay you the price named, though
in telling you I may be betraying an official
secret. You probably know that your property
line on the north abuts on the Whitlow lands
about an eighth of a mile from your tramway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good. Now we have a vein of coal
quite near this joint boundary; not a very thick
vein, but one which could be made to pay for
working if we could send the coal down over
your tramway, and coke it in your old ovens at
Coalville, but which would not pay if we should
be obliged to build a new tramway to get at it.
That is the whole thing in a nutshell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that this offer of a hundred thousand
for the Ocoee was once made to my father? It&#8217;s
odd that I had never heard of it. Was it in any
sense a standing offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was at the time, and I think it still is,
though there has been no talk of it latterly, so
far as I know. But since the reasons for making
it still exist, I should imagine that you would
stand a good chance of reviving it if you should
care to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only had a little breakfast in me!&#8221; Tregarvon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
protested half-jokingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m too hungry
to talk hundred-thousand-dollar deals with you
with any assurance that an empty stomach isn&#8217;t
making me flighty, Mr. Thaxter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bookkeeper laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are your men coming over from the
tramhead,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Give them your orders,
and then let me drive you down to Coalville to
your breakfast. Perhaps you&#8217;ll be willing to
give me a bite, too, and in that case I shall have
the pleasure of meeting Mr. Carfax again. I
didn&#8217;t more than half get acquainted with him
the day he drove up to Whitlow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certainly the jolliest lot of commercial
pirates a man ever had to fight&mdash;you people
up at the C. C. &amp; I.,&#8221; said Tregarvon, after he
had climbed into the buggy with Thaxter and the
spirited black horse was flinging the soft sand of
the wood road from his hoofs. &#8220;First, Wilmerding
comes to the rescue; and now you are trying
to give us a lift. It&#8217;s heart-warming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxter&#8217;s rejoinder had just the requisite touch
of friendly solicitude in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you meant what you said a few moments
ago, about the financial aspect of the&mdash;of
your experiment? A hundred thousand dollars
would be worth considering?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;That amount would look as big as a hundred
thousand cart-wheels to me, just now,&#8221; Tregarvon
confided. &#8220;My father is dead, as I suppose
you know, and there have been family misfortunes
big enough to sink a ship. A hundred thousand
would give us a fresh start in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must certainly try to get it for you,&#8221;
was the affable rejoinder; and from this on, the
spirited horse demanded Thaxter&#8217;s undivided attention,
so pointedly that the bookkeeper did not
even seem to see Professor Hartridge when the
buggy whirled past that gentleman as he was
returning from his morning walk down the pike.</p>

<p>Carfax was waiting breakfast on Tregarvon
when the black horse came to a stand at the door
of the Ocoee office-building. The young millionaire
remembered Thaxter perfectly, and seemed
to be glad to renew his acquaintance with the
&#8220;Brother Cheeryble.&#8221; Yet it was Carfax&#8217;s judicious
applying of the brakes at the breakfast-table
conference of three that kept Tregarvon
from committing himself too definitely in the
matter of bargain and sale.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the talk over the ham and eggs
pushed the business affair considerably farther
along on the road to a tentative conclusion. Before
he took his leave to continue his return drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
to Whitlow, Thaxter was authorized to communicate
by wire with the New York headquarters of
Consolidated Coal, and, without betraying any
confidences, to ascertain if the offer of one hundred
thousand dollars for the Ocoee properties
still held good.</p>

<p>After Thaxter had taken his departure, and the
two young experimenters had threshed the new
prospect out to its final straw, the wakeful night
came in for its revenges, and they slept through
the forenoon. Rucker did not return from Whitlow
with the car and the repointed drills until long
after the noon meal; and when he came he found
his two employers waiting impatiently for him&mdash;or
rather for the car. The reason for the impatience
was a note from Miss Richardia sent down
by the college mail-carrier early in the afternoon;
a brief message addressed to both, begging them
to come to Highmount at the earliest possible
moment: urgency only; no hint of what had
happened or was due to happen.</p>

<p>They made the ascent of the mountain as
rapidly as the big touring-car could measure the
distance, and were met at the door of the administration
building of the college, not by Miss
Birrell, but by Professor Hartridge, who led them
into the visitors&#8217; parlor and calmly informed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that Miss Richardia had driven to Westwood
House with her father shortly after luncheon.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, now!&#8221; lisped Carfax; &#8220;that&#8217;s rather
curious, don&#8217;t you know!&#8221; And Tregarvon was
quite speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious that Miss Birrell should ask you to
come up here, and then run away?&#8221; said Hartridge.
&#8220;It was a little ruse of mine, and Miss
Richardia is altogether blameless. I wished very
much to see you both, and I was afraid you might
be foolish enough to disregard an invitation
bearing my name. So I took Miss Richardia
into my confidence, and she very obligingly wrote
the note which, I assume, has brought you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax snapped his fingers and laughed softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon what footing do we stand with you,
Mr. Hartridge?&mdash;upon that of yesterday at
dinner-time or upon that of a later hour, when
I had the pleasure of helping you on with your
overcoat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t presume to say, Mr. Carfax;
you must make your own attitude. But if that
attitude should be inimical, I must still beg you
to believe that I have decoyed you up here to
do you a kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was still smiling affably. &#8220;Is it Virgil
who puts it into the mouth of one of his characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
to say that we should beware of the Greeks
bringing gifts, professor? You will pardon us
if we seem a bit suspicious, won&#8217;t you? But
this&#8221;&mdash;he held up the small cube of hardened
steel which he happened to have in his pocket&mdash;&#8220;this
is so completely convincing, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mild-eyed mathematician waved the evidence
aside as a thing of small moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you have had time to consider,
I am sure you absolve me from the charge of
having tampered with your drill-hole,&#8221; he deprecated.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; said Carfax. &#8220;All you did was to
cover the retreat of the man who really did the
tampering. But that is sufficient to make us&mdash;er&mdash;a
bit cautious, as you might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge smiled in his turn. &#8220;You are basing
your caution upon a small specimen of the
metal commercially known as steel which you
chanced to find in my pocket,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Let us disregard the bit of steel for the time
being, if you please. If you should happen to
lose it, it could be very easily replaced; but&#8221;&mdash;he
turned short upon Tregarvon&mdash;&#8220;you can&#8217;t
replace the Ocoee if you allow Mr. Thaxter to
persuade you to sell it to Consolidated Coal,
Mr. Tregarvon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed the Ocoee owner,
starting from his chair; and Carfax fell back
upon his strongest expletive, &#8220;By Jove!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge appeared to be entirely at ease now.
He seated himself and crossed his long legs comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are puzzled to account for my friendly
interest?&mdash;after last night?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t blame you, and I am only sorry that I
cannot explain more fully. But I may say this:
if you part with the Ocoee properties for any such
sum as Mr. Thaxter has doubtless offered you,
you will regret it as long as you live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax got his breath sufficiently after a time
to say: &#8220;May&mdash;may we venture to ask how
you know what Mr. Thaxter has offered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. The offer of one hundred thousand
dollars for the lands, titles, and mineral
rights of the property is no secret&mdash;or at least
it was not during Mr. Tregarvon&#8217;s father&#8217;s lifetime.
I am merely assuming that Thaxter has
not increased it; and I am also assuming that a
renewal of the offer was the reason for his early
morning drive with Mr. Tregarvon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you say Vance will be sorry if he accepts
the offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do; most decidedly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>Carfax leaned forward and held up an accusing
finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you know, of your own knowledge,
that there is a workable vein of coal on the property,
Mr. Hartridge,&#8221; he snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, my dear sir, is an assumption which
I must decline to confirm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, it is true. And here is another
to go with it: <i>you know where that vein can
be found!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge smiled again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, constructively at least, my guest,
Mr. Carfax; I should be unpardonably rude if
I were to contradict you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax glanced aside at Tregarvon, and Tregarvon
returned the glance as one who sees the
shore from the crest of a tossing wave, but has
no hope of reaching it. After a little pause
Carfax renewed the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a most extraordinary situation, don&#8217;t
you think, Mr. Hartridge?&#8221; he began mildly.
&#8220;Would a definite quantity of the thing known
commercially as money tend to relieve it in any
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor&#8217;s answer was prompt and decisive.
&#8220;You are assuming that I have information
to sell? I have not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Carfax countered, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why have you just given us this pointer
on Consolidated Coal? You profess to be willing
to help us and you refuse to help us in one
and the same breath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you are going into motives, my dear
sir, that is, indeed, a very deep subject. It
would hardly be profitable to discuss it, even
academically. Life, the really human variety
of life, is full of paradoxes. You are wondering
why the man from whom, a few hours ago, you
took that small cube of steel, is now apparently
trying to save you from loss. Call it one of the
human paradoxes, if you will; only don&#8217;t sell
to Consolidated Coal for a paltry hundred thousand
dollars a property upon which more than
three or four times that amount has been spent.
This is what I enticed you up here to say to
you; and having said it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; Carfax interposed. &#8220;We have
met some curious varieties of the genus enemy
in this forgotten corner of the world, and you
will pardon me if I say that you are not the least
remarkable specimen, Mr. Hartridge. We are
thankful for the pointer, and much more thankful
for the assurance you have given us that we
are not fishing in a barren pond. We&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>The professor had risen and was moving toward
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given you no such specific assurance,&#8221;
he denied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tregarvon, getting upon his feet
and putting in a word for himself. &#8220;You may
congratulate yourself upon your discretion. None
the less, we shall continue to work on our problem,
Mr. Hartridge, until we have found the
value of &#8216;<i>pi</i>&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a centre shot, visibly and palpably
piercing the bull&#8217;s-eye. A blow would scarcely
have disconcerted the schoolmaster more effectively.
Yet he recovered instantly, had blandly
excused himself upon the plea of pressing laboratory
work, and was bowing himself out at
the door, when he fired the return shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have set yourselves an impossible task,
gentlemen,&#8221; he offered mildly. &#8220;You forget
that the value of &#8216;<i>pi</i>&#8217; has never yet been exactly
ascertained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you make of it all?&#8221; Tregarvon
asked, when the yellow car was rolling smoothly
down the mountain pike on the return to Coalville.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing; except a disappointment for Mr.
Thaxter,&#8221; was Carfax&#8217;s reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Thaxter; yes. Do you know, Poictiers, I&#8217;m
beginning to smell brimstone in <i>his</i> clothes, now.
Wilmerding told us definitely, if you remember,
that Thaxter gave him to understand that he
didn&#8217;t have any data on the Ocoee; didn&#8217;t know
anything remotely concerning it. There is a lie
out, somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which doesn&#8217;t matter now, thanks to Mr.
William Wilberforce Hartridge, the man of mixed
motives,&#8221; said Carfax definitively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, on the strength of Hartridge&#8217;s
warning, that I shouldn&#8217;t sell to Consolidated
Coal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was driving the car and he let the
brakes out until the machine was dropping down
the grade like a stone falling from a height.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in a thousand years!&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII<br />


<small>An Anticlimax</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BRIGHT and early on the Saturday morning
the two young men, with the repointed drill
bits in the car, drove to the mountain top,
carrying Rucker&#8217;s breakfast in a basket generously
filled by Mrs. Tryon. They found the
mechanician, who had resumed his job of night-watching,
already up and stirring, with the engine
fired and ready for starting, and there were
no disturbances to report.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did a little stunt of my own,&#8221; Rucker explained
with a grin, showing a concealed wire
which ran all around the glade and led to the
tool-house. &#8220;Yesterday, up at Whitlow, I fished
an electric bell out of the scrap heap, and last
night, before I went to bed, I rigged it so that if
anybody come monkeyin&#8217; &#8217;round, it&#8217;d ring and
wake me up. I guess there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t any ghost-walkin&#8217;.
The bell didn&#8217;t ring, and everything
was all shipshape this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon after this the drilling was resumed, not,
however, until after the hole had been carefully
washed and swabbed out. Tregarvon did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
take any of his men into his confidence to the extent
of explaining the reason for the extra care,
but during the swabbing process he stood aside
and looked on, watchful to detect any sign of
guilty knowledge on the part of his helpers. Particularly
he studied the face of the younger
McNabb, the one who had been hurt still being
absent. The effort went for nothing. If isolation
has been sparing of gifts to the native of the
southern Appalachians, it has at least given him
a face that no man can read. The bushy-bearded
Sawyer, the head driller, was the only one who
commented upon the hole-cleaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit don&#8217;t look t&#8217; me like thar was anything
more &#8217;n the drill dust to be warshed out,&#8221; he
grumbled, when the swab came up clean; and to
prove it he rubbed some of the powdered rock
cuttings between his thumb and finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to be sure than sorry,&#8221; said Tregarvon.
&#8220;If we know that the hole is clean to
begin with, we&#8217;re that much ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>In due course of time the engine was started,
the drill lowered, and the churning was resumed.
Very shortly it became evident that the steel was
cutting again at the usual rate, and Tregarvon&#8217;s
spirits rose accordingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Poictiers, I believe we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
going to &#8216;prove up&#8217; right here on this spot?&#8221; he
predicted, after the work was well under way
and they had gone to sit on the tool-house step.
&#8220;The indications all point for us. Here is where
the most determined fight has been made to stop
us; here is where we find Hartridge&#8217;s hieroglyphics
on the trees; and right here, if you&#8217;ll remark
it, is where Mr. Onias Thaxter hunts me
up to make me a blanket offer for my landholdings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little more time will tell the story,&#8221; Carfax
suggested. &#8220;By noon, if it doesn&#8217;t strike any
more bones, the drill ought to be down to the
coal, if there is any coal here.&#8221;</p>

<p>With hope trotting cheerfully on ahead, the
forenoon became a period of exciting suspense.
Each time the drill was withdrawn the cuttings
were examined eagerly. The rock was showing
all the characteristics of the former borings: fine
sandstone, coarse sandstone, some little conglomerate,
and, just before the noon hour, the
shales which commonly overlie the coal in the
Cumberland region.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re coming to it!&#8221; Tregarvon exulted,
when the washings which came up in the churning
began to show black. &#8220;Eighteen inches more,
and we&#8217;ll know whether we live or die!&#8221; And he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
carefully made a chalk-mark on the drill so that
they might determine when the critical depth was
reached.</p>

<p>As in the previous tests, the steel sank rapidly
in the vein of coal. At a foot of additional
depth the washings were still coming up black.
At sixteen inches there was no change. Sighting
across a derrick brace, Tregarvon watched the
chalk-mark with the blood racing in his veins.
With each plunge of the heavy steel drill his
hopes rose higher. Already he was anticipating
a future which, if it should lack some of the ecstasies,
would still have a sufficiency of the great
emollient&mdash;money. With a fortune of his own,
the impossible situation which had grown out of
the Uncle Byrd legacy would be alleviated, and
he saw himself deeding his half of the legacy
irrevocably over to Elizabeth. The pride wound
thus healed, the broken bones of sentiment might
be allowed to knit as they would. Doubtless,
in time, the knitting process would accomplish
itself, and possibly without leaving him a hopeless
cripple. Judging from the past, Elizabeth would
not expect much; and even if he should be obliged
to limp a little she would probably never notice it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen inches!&#8221; he called out to Carfax,
&#8220;and she&#8217;s still bringing up the black-diamond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
dust! Get ready to blow the hewgag and beat
the tom-tom. We&#8217;re in it, this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy!&#8221; Carfax cautioned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let your
hopes soar too high. Maybe the top vein runs
a little thicker at this point than it did in the
others. Call it that, anyway, until you&#8217;re cocksure.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke the power went off. Tregarvon
jerked his watch from his pocket and stifled a
hard word. It was noon, and the men were knocking
off work on the dot, quite as nonchalantly as
if the fate of empires were not hanging upon the
result of a few more turns of the machinery.
Tregarvon tramped across to the tool-house with
Carfax, a sudden weariness making his feet heavy
as lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the workman of it!&#8221; he gritted. &#8220;If
the world were coming to an end in the next five
minutes, they&#8217;d stop to eat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax permitted himself a subdued chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are beautifully on edge,&#8221; he asserted.
&#8220;A few inches more may mean a lot to you, but
it&#8217;s all in the day&#8217;s work for the men. They&#8217;re
not going to get rich out of your coal mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had brought some of Uncle William&#8217;s
biscuits and cold chicken for the midday snack,
and Carfax went to the motor-car, which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
been left standing in the wood road, for the
basket. When he returned, Tregarvon was pacing
back and forth impatiently before the tool-house
door, and Rucker was sitting on the step,
eating his luncheon. Carfax carried the basket
inside, and they made a table of the coil of rope.
While they were picking the chicken bones, the
mechanician spoke again of a matter that he had
mentioned once or twice before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beefin&#8217; ag&#8217;in about that boiler, Mr. Tregarvon,&#8221;
he began, between workman mouthfuls
of Mrs. Tryon&#8217;s corn bread. &#8220;She ain&#8217;t much,
just as I told you at first; and draggin&#8217; her &#8217;round
over this mountain hain&#8217;t helped her none. She&#8217;s
leakin&#8217; like a sieve at the fire-box end of her
flues, right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping that this is the last hole we&#8217;ll
have to drill with it, Billy,&#8221; said Tregarvon cheerfully.
&#8220;I bought it second-hand, and the Chattanooga
junk man put one over on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sure did,&#8221; Rucker returned with a grin.
&#8220;She&#8217;s rotten. Every time the pop-valve goes
off it makes me jump. One o&#8217; these days&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The interruption was a blatant roar from the
boiler in question. Rucker had prudently shut
the drafts and had left the fire-door open, or he
thought he had, but still the pressure had crept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
up, until now the safety-valve was relieving it.
Through the open door of the tool-shack the two
at the rope-coil table could see the plant, with
the plume of escaping steam rising to the height
of the tree-tops. As usual during the noon hour,
there was not a man of the gang in sight. Tregarvon
had early learned that a part of the country
laborer&#8217;s reticence expressed itself in a dislike
to eat under the boss&#8217;s eye. At the stopping of
the machinery the drill-gang would scatter in the
wood, each man to his fallen log.</p>

<p>The roar of the safety-valve continuing, and
seeming to increase in stridency rather than to
diminish, Tregarvon leaned forward to shout in
Rucker&#8217;s ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you left the fire-box door open,
Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mechanician struggled to his feet. &#8220;I
thought I was, but I&#8217;ll go see. She&#8217;s howlin&#8217;
a little bit too loud to suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth
when the earthquake crash came. With a sound
that was oddly like the tearing of a hundred
saws through dry timber, followed by a reverberating
thunderclap, the boiler and engine
vanished in a thick cloud of steam, and the air
was filled with flying missiles. One piece of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
boiler tore the heart out of the sheltering oak-tree;
another fragment ripped a corner from the
tool-house; a third mowed a swath through a
thicket of young pines.</p>

<p>Tregarvon and Carfax were both up and out
before the nimbus cloud of steam had blown
aside, and their first thought was for their men.
Rucker had escaped only by a hair&#8217;s-breadth.
The twisted fire-box sheet which had knocked
a corner out of the small building had passed so
close that the wind of it had bowled him over.
Tregarvon left Carfax to help the machinist to
his feet, and ran shouting across the glade. The
drill gang answered and came hurrying in, a
man at a time. When all were accounted for,
the material loss was inventoried. It was total,
so far as it went. The engine and boiler were
reduced to a tangled heap of scrap; one end of
the drill beam was shattered, and one leg of the
derrick had suffered loss.</p>

<p>For the moment Tregarvon was torn by conflicting
emotions; a huge thankfulness that no
life had been lost and bitter disappointment
that the catastrophe had come at the instant
when all the doubts as to the value of the Ocoee
were to be either confirmed or swept away. He
held himself together long enough to tell the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
men that they might go home&mdash;that there would
be nothing more done until a new power-plant
could be bought; but when Rucker had gone
out to the wood road to see if the yellow car
had been hit, and the disappointed one was
left alone with Carfax, the flood-gates gave
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it enough to make an angel out of the
blue heavens swear himself black in the face,
Poictiers?&#8221; he raged. &#8220;Just on the very edge
of things&mdash;just as we were going to find out,
once for all, what this cursed mountain is going
to do to us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing at a time,&#8221; Carfax broke in soothingly.
&#8220;The wrecked engine isn&#8217;t fatal&mdash;not by
many parasangs: it came just in the nick of
time, when I was wondering what under the sun
I should do with the dividend draft that I got
in the mail yesterday. Take a fresh grip on
yourself and remember that you have a good
bit to be thankful for. If your men had been
sitting around on the job to eat their dinners,
as laborers do up North, there&#8217;d be another
story to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know; but think of it&mdash;it will be days
and maybe weeks before we can get a new power-plant
installed, and all that time we&#8217;ll be hanging,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
like Mahomet&#8217;s coffin, between heaven and
earth; won&#8217;t know any more than we do now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rucker had come back to report that the motor-car
had escaped as by a miracle. A square yard
of the boiler shell had been hurled over it to fall
accurately in the middle of the road a rod or
two farther on. While he was telling about it,
a goodly portion of the faculty of Highmount
College, followed by a bevy of young women,
came upon the scene. Doctor Caswell was heading
the column of reconnaissance, and Hartridge
also was with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; exclaimed the president, coming
up breathless; &#8220;we are all so glad to find you
alive! What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon pointed to the tangled mass of
wreckage. &#8220;Our boiler blew up. It was old,
and I suppose we were carrying too much pressure.
Luckily, it happened while the men were
eating, and there was no one near enough to be
hurt. I thought of you people at once. It must
have made racket enough to make you think the
end of the world was coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was frightful!&#8221; said Miss Farron. &#8220;The
windows rattled and&mdash;&#8221; but here her voice was
lost in the chorus of excited exclamations pitching
themselves in many keys as the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
women picked their way over to the wreck and
viewed the remains.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well, sometimes, to be born both lucky
and rich,&#8221; Hartridge commented gravely, when
his turn came. &#8220;The material loss is serious
enough, of course; but you ought to be thankful
that no lives were lost. Were you near enough
at the time to see the explosion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were sitting in the tool-house eating our
luncheon,&#8221; Carfax explained, &#8220;and Rucker was
just outside. We had been speaking of the
boiler a moment before. We were all three looking
at it, I think, when it went up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Caswell had taken his wife over to assist
in the sight-seeing, but Hartridge lingered behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happening in broad daylight, this way,
with three of you looking on, I suppose you are
well assured that it was a pure accident?&#8221; he
suggested quietly.</p>

<p>Tregarvon left the answer to Carfax, who made
it promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you say, we are not able, this time, to
blame any one but ourselves. The boiler was
old, and our mechanic had told us that it was
not altogether safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been drilling to-day?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Carfax nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask if you found anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon turned away and busied himself
examining the rent in the corner of the tool
shanty. Carfax called up the cherubic smile
for the inquiring professor and said: &#8220;What if
I should tell you that we have found our bonanza,
Mr. Hartridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge glanced at the drill, which was still
standing in the test-hole, and shook his head.
&#8220;I should say that you are merely talking for
effect,&#8221; he smiled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we have found the coal,&#8221; Carfax persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have found the upper measure, the same
as you have in all the other trials. Beneath it,
you will find your sandstone dike again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we have already reached a depth of more
than eighteen inches, and the drill was still in
coal when we shut down for the noon stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite immaterial,&#8221; was the cool-voiced
reply. &#8220;The measures vary in thickness,
though not greatly. Geology is one of my small
side-lines, Mr. Carfax, and I have made a study
of this particular region, largely as a pastime.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>The sight-seers were straggling back, and Tregarvon
was explaining to a group of breathless
maidens just where he had been sitting with
Carfax at the moment of catastrophes, and how
Rucker had been knocked down by the wind of
the fragment which had struck the corner of the
tool-shed. Carfax saw his opportunity preparing
to take its leave and he smiled, level-eyed,
at Hartridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still on the obstructive hand, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he threw in. &#8220;Even now, you would
like to discourage us if you could.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor of mathematics and other things
was turning away to join the others, but he
paused for a low-toned rejoinder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I neither deny nor affirm, Mr. Carfax. But
I may say this much: if I were in your shoes, or
Mr. Tregarvon&#8217;s, I shouldn&#8217;t call to-day&#8217;s disaster
a pure accident&mdash;until I could prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he turned his back and began
to talk to the art teacher.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII<br />


<small>Evolutionary</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INTENT upon the swift purchase of another
power-plant, Tregarvon caught an afternoon
freight on the branch railroad, made a late train
on the main line, and was obliged to spend the
Sunday in Chattanooga, with little to console him
save the thought that he would be on hand to
transact business with the machinery merchants
bright and early Monday morning.</p>

<p>It was a sad Sunday, weatherwise, with a
chill autumn rain sweeping the streets of the
battle-field city, and the crest of Lookout Mountain
veiled in cloud. Tregarvon had made a few
business acquaintances in town on previous purchasing
expeditions, but there were no familiar
faces in the hotel; nothing to lighten the monotony
of a dreary day of enforced idleness.</p>

<p>In such circumstances impatience becomes a
rat to gnaw the vitals. The suspense, the tormenting
uncertainty which he had left behind
him in the unfinished test-hole on the summit of
Mount Pisgah, would have been hard to endure
even in a whirlwind of work; and upon a day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
when he could neither work nor play he was in
despair.</p>

<p>After the noon meal, which figured as &#8220;Luncheon&#8221;
on the hotel bill of fare, and was, in point
of fact, a heavy and dispiriting midday dinner,
he braved the elements and went in a closed
sight-seeing car to the Chickamauga battle-field.
The drive proved to be a damp test of endurance,
and he brought nothing back from it better than
a memory of rain-sodden fields and forest; of
endless colonnades of gray, ghostly monuments,
a majority of them assuring the beholder in letters
of granite that here the Ohio troops fought nobly;
of parkings of ancient cannon, the guns pointing
in so many different directions that no human
being could guess which way the battle had run;
of the droning singsong of the chauffeur pouring
his explanation patter into the reversed megaphone
for the benefit of his few fares.</p>

<p>The return to the hotel was merely a change
from outdoor dreariness to indoor. The lobby
was a gathering-ground for a scattering of disgruntled
tourists, who had used their battle-field
stop-over privilege only to find themselves marooned
by the weather. Tregarvon smoked in
solitary misery for what remained of the afternoon,
and past the evening meal, begged some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
the hotel stationery, and wrote a letter to Elizabeth
Wardwell.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a sin and a shame to write you after such
a day as I&#8217;ve been wearing out here,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;but you know my weakness for afflicting other
people&mdash;for unloading my woes upon the nearest
pair of sympathetic shoulders. Your shoulders
have always been that; and sometimes I wonder
that you can still stand up straight and queenly,
as you do, after having carried so many of my
burdens.&#8221; Here followed an account of the events
of the exciting Saturday forenoon, and he tried,
as well as the written words would serve, to transmit
some picture of the boiler explosion, tagged
with an attempt to portray the tenterhooks of
suspense upon which the disaster had impaled
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see where it leaves me,&#8221; he went on;
&#8220;still in the air as to whether the Ocoee is something
or nothing. For a few little minutes, after
the drill had passed the eighteen-inch dead-line,
I saw rose-colored, saw my chance to provide
for the home-folks, and to ignore forever and a
day, the Uncle Byrd legacy. But now I am no
better assured than I was before we began drilling;
and, to make it more interesting, Hartridge happened
along after the explosion&mdash;the whole college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
turned out and came tramping over through
the wood to see what had broken loose&mdash;and he
says the sandstone dike is still under us. We
shan&#8217;t know positively, of course, until we can
get a new engine, and haul it by inches up the
mountain, and drag it into place and set it going;
and by that time I shall be a raving maniac.</p>

<p>&#8220;In all this new trouble, Poictiers has been all
that you&#8217;d expect him to be; a friend to tie to.
He doesn&#8217;t lend me money; he simply tosses me
his purse. I have his last dividend check in my
pocket at this present moment, and I&#8217;m to cash
it to-morrow morning to pay for the new engine.
I suppose I needn&#8217;t say that I should have been
out of the fight down here long ago if he hadn&#8217;t
joined me and given me a checking account.
He is pure gold, Elizabeth; and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;The gap represents a good half-hour, my dear
cousin, in which I have been sitting here at this
dinky little table in the hotel writing-room, trying
to screw my courage to the sticking-place.
What I have to tell you concerns four people,
and you are one of the four. I&#8217;ve written you
a lot about Richardia Birrell&mdash;she&#8217;s another one
of the four&mdash;in the past few weeks, and I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
been assuring myself all along that I have been
telling you all there was to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t strictly true, Elizabeth. There
was a thing that I wouldn&#8217;t admit, even to myself;
but I had to admit it three days ago when
Poictiers told me that he had asked Richardia to
be his wife. I knew then what Richardia had
done to me, and for a bad half-hour I&mdash;well, I&#8217;m
not going into details; it is enough to say that
I&#8217;m not fit to be your door-mat, Betha, dear&mdash;nor
Poictiers Carfax&#8217;s, for that matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I say for myself more than I have
said a hundred times in the past? Nothing, I
imagine; I&#8217;m simply hopeless where the eternal
feminine is concerned. You&#8217;ve known it ever
since we went to school together, and you&#8217;ve
promised to marry me in spite of the knowledge.
I shall not be a faithless husband, my dear&mdash;I
know I shan&#8217;t be that; and this last and most
humiliating lapse could never have amounted
to anything, anyway, even if Poictiers had not
slammed the door in my face. But it is your
right to know about it; to know that for some
few days or hours or minutes, as the case may
be, I was daffy, foolish, a simpleton from the
idiotic wards, with a slant toward depravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see now what an incredible friend Poictiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
is. I&#8217;ve never thought of him as a marrying
man, and I could swear, even now, that he
isn&#8217;t in love with Richardia&mdash;though I don&#8217;t
quite see how any free man with live blood in
him could help being. Let that go: Poictiers has
killed my temptation for me. He has asked Richardia
to marry him, and he and she are good
enough for each other&mdash;which is the highest
praise I can offer to either. Poictiers will get a
wife who could make any man happy; and Richardia
will be able to restore the Birrell fortunes,
which, as you have doubtless gathered from my
earlier letters, are pretty sadly in need of a rich
marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;This leaves us two to face things as they are
as best we can, Elizabeth. After what I have
written down in this letter, can you still care
enough for me, and for the conventions and the
wishes of the families on both sides, to&mdash;not to
forgive me; I&#8217;m not going to ask that&mdash;but to
take me just as I am, and let things go on as
before? I shan&#8217;t blame you in the least if you
can&#8217;t, you know; but if it must come to a break
between us, you must let me be the one to make
the break. By all right and reason the Uncle
Byrd legacy is yours; and whatever happens, I
promise you I shall never touch a penny of it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;Good night, my dear. My love for you is
precisely the same as it has always been. The
madness which Richardia Birrell was stirring up
in me was something entirely different, and no
doubt everybody would say it was worlds less
worthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon had a bad habit of not reading his
letters after they were written and signed, and
he did not break the habit now. Folding, sealing,
and addressing his confession, he went to the
lobby to mail it. Thanks to the rainy Sunday,
the hotel mail-box was stuffed to repletion with
week-end missives, and Tregarvon, after trying in
vain to wedge his own through the slit, exemplified
his careless habit by leaving it on top of the box
with the newspapers.</p>

<p>Later in the evening there were other additions
made to the overflow newspaper mail, and some
one, still more careless than the Philadelphian,
displaced the letter, which fell, unnoted, to the
floor. Here, during the small hours, one of the
sweepers found it; and since some muddy boot
heel had defaced the postage-stamp, and all but
obliterated the address, the sweeper passed his
find on to the night clerk. At this point another
phase of Tregarvon&#8217;s heedlessness came to the
fore. He had neglected to put his own name and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
address in the corner of the envelope, hence the
clerk had no means of identifying the sender.
Being a young man of resource, he enclosed the
letter, just as it was, in a larger envelope, copying,
or trying to copy, the address. But the marring
boot heel had done its work too thoroughly. The
Philadelphia street number was entirely effaced;
and &#8220;Miss Elizabeth Wardwell&#8221; became, in the
night clerk&#8217;s transcription, &#8220;Miss Eliza Bell
Woodwell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was astir early on the Monday
morning, was fortunate enough to be able to purchase
the new power-plant without waiting to
have it shipped in from some Northern supply
house, hustled busily until he had seen his purchase
entrained for Coalville, and took the afternoon
local for his return. As often happened,
the local was late, and he found Carfax waiting
dinner for him when he dropped off on the office-building
side of the train at the home station.</p>

<p>Over Uncle William&#8217;s chicken gumbo the talk
ran easily upon the business affair. Tregarvon
had driven a rather good bargain on the new
engine, and was inclined to expatiate upon it.
In reality, however, he was trying to postpone
the moment when Carfax should begin to talk
of the more intimate things. That moment came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
with the pipe-filling before the cheerful wood-fire,
after Uncle William had cleared the table and
disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you left, Saturday, I took Hartridge&#8217;s
hint and went into the explosion details a little
deeper,&#8221; said Carfax. &#8220;Rucker stayed with me
and lent me his mechanical wit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the verdict?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Scotch verdict: &#8216;Not proven,&#8217;&#8221; was
the thoughtful rejoinder. &#8220;Knowing, as we do,
that at least one attempt was made to dynamite
the boiler, I may have been oversuspicious.
In such circumstances the judicial frame of mind
is hard to attain. Rucker swears he left the
furnace-door open when we stopped at noon.
When we found the front sheet of the boiler three
or four hundred yards away in the woods, the
door was shut and latched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That proves nothing,&#8221; Tregarvon said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; anything might happen to a door, or to
anything else, in a hurry trip of that kind. On
the other hand, it would have been a very easy
matter for some one to have sneaked up on the
farther side of the engine while we were eating.
And Rucker insists that only the closed door
could have accounted for the sudden rise in pressure
which caused the explosion.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll never know,&#8221; was Tregarvon&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;But why Hartridge should shield our obstacle-thrower
at one time, and try to set us on to him
at another, is beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax smiled soberly. &#8220;Mr. William W.
Hartridge appears to be a unique. I had the
pleasure of meeting him again, socially, no longer
ago than yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You spent the Sunday at Highmount?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I did better than that. Wilmerding was
down from Whitlow, and I found that he knows
Judge Birrell familiarly and well. I took my
courage in my hand, borrowed your beast of a
car, and Wilmerding and I drove to Westwood
House in the rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have met Richardia&#8217;s father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have; and a finer old citizen doesn&#8217;t exist.
That suspicion of yours that he may be inspiring
the fight on us is all bosh. He isn&#8217;t at all the
kind of man to knife an enemy in the dark. He
is a poem on the Old South, Vance; a whole
heart-breaking epic. His manners would put a
Chesterfield to shame; and you can see at once
where Richardia gets her keen little mind. The
judge was disposed to place me in the Parker
class at first&mdash;quite naturally; I could see that
plainly enough&mdash;that, and his prejudice against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
all things Northern. But I was there as the
friend of his friend Wilmerding, and that settled
it. A Bedouin chief couldn&#8217;t have been more
hospitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told him you were going to marry Richardia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no; you mustn&#8217;t hurry things that
way!&#8221; laughed the golden one. &#8220;You simply
<i>can&#8217;t</i> hurry them, you know, with a man like
Judge Birrell. But I flatter myself that I made
good in the try-out. Hartridge was there, with
Miss Farron&mdash;though I can&#8217;t imagine how they
got over from Highmount in the rain&mdash;so there
was quite a house-party of us. At dinner-time
it was raining harder than ever, and the judge
wouldn&#8217;t hear to our going, though I had the
top up on the car, and, of course, offered to take
Hartridge and Miss Farron back to the college.
So we all stayed to dinner. That dinner would
have broken your heart, Vance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it showed in a thousand little ways
what the family has been, and what it has now
come to. The china was S&egrave;vres, but much of it
was chipped and broken, and hardly any two
pieces were alike. The table-cloth had once been
somebody&#8217;s pride, but it had been laundered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
darned until it was like a piece of old lace. The
silver was evidently an heirloom, and it was so
worn with much polishing that you could scarcely
make out the engraving. We had chicken&mdash;I
imagine nobody in the South ever gets so poor
that he can&#8217;t have chicken&mdash;but the luxuries were
conspicuous by their absence. Do you know what
I think, Vance? I believe that the Westwood
House cash assets are measured exactly by the
size of Richardia&#8217;s Highmount salary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; said Tregarvon, keenly
sympathetic. &#8220;Richardia has given me to understand
that there is a lot of mountain land, which
is practically valueless now that the tan-bark
timber has all been cut off; but there is nothing
to bring an income.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilmerding has told me something of the
judge&#8217;s involvement with the original Ocoee promoters,
and the struggle he made to keep his
name good after he and his friends had been
frozen out,&#8221; Carfax resumed. &#8220;He had recommended
the scheme to a good many others, and
when the smash came, he stripped himself bare
to make good the losses of his friends, withholding
nothing but a little money he had put
aside for Richardia&#8217;s musical education.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon nodded. &#8220;That explains something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
that Richardia said to me one time when we were
talking about people marrying and settling down;
she said, in that perfectly straightforward way of
hers, that she would like to marry, but that she
was in debt, and couldn&#8217;t marry until after she
had earned enough money to pay herself out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has said something of the same nature
to me,&#8221; Carfax admitted. &#8220;But it seems that
there were other troubles besides the property
losses. The judge had a son, a year or so older
than Richardia. He was a school-boy at the time
of the big smash, but was old enough, Wilmerding
says, to be hot-headed and a bit wild and
ungovernable. Parker, the promoter, was foolish
enough to show up here again, after the <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>;
and this boy actually tried to kill him; emptied
a pistol at him, winged him with one of the shots,
and then ran away. He has never been heard
from since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all new to me,&#8221; Tregarvon commented.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know Richardia had a brother.
She has never spoken of him to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wilmerding says nobody ever speaks of
him,&#8221; Carfax went on. &#8220;Parker was vindictive,
and pushed the assault case. A grand jury
found a true bill against young Birrell, and a
warrant was issued for his arrest. He couldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
be found; has never been found. His son&#8217;s disappearance,
and the struggle to keep faith with
his friends, made the judge what he is now, a
proud, broken-spirited old hermit who is carrying
the heaviest burden a father can bear&mdash;the
disgrace of a son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Disgrace?&#8221; echoed Tregarvon. &#8220;It&#8217;s hardly
that, is it? Haven&#8217;t we been taught that it is
a part of the Southern code that a son should
shoot his father&#8217;s betrayer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; that part of it was all right. The
disgrace was in showing the white feather by
running away; in not staying to face the consequences.
As a matter of fact, I don&#8217;t suppose
there would have been any consequences. Any
jury that could have been impanelled in this
vicinity at that particular time would have acquitted
the boy. The cowardly streak is what
broke the judge&#8217;s heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This story of the boy opens up a bit of new
ground,&#8221; said Tregarvon musingly. &#8220;I wonder
if Richardia doesn&#8217;t know where he is? She
has given me the impression, more than once,
that she has a deep-buried trouble of some sort&mdash;a
trouble that she never shares with anybody.
Haven&#8217;t you had the same notion?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t need to go that far afield to find
her troubles. The wrecked family fortunes, and
a broken old man to shield and comfort and
care for on a music teacher&#8217;s wages, are enough
to fill all the requirements, I should imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely. But as to the money hardship ...
you&#8217;ll be able to change all that, Poictiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax rose, knocked the ashes from his pipe,
and slowly refilled it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come to see things in their right
light, at last, have you?&#8221; he inquired at the end
of the little interval of silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Partly. There is only one light in which they
can be seen. I had no shadow of right to fall in
love with Richardia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said Carfax in his gentlest
tone. &#8220;Are you sure it was real? You know,
you have had so many of these&mdash;er&mdash;these little
erotic explosions in the past&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; was the humble admission. &#8220;But
this was different. You may say that the difference
lay in the fact that it was forbidden,
and point me to the moral twist&mdash;as old as the
race&mdash;that makes the forbidden thing figure as
the one thing altogether desirable. Doubtless I
have the twist, in common with other men: but
the difference remains.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>&#8220;You have written to Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I wrote last night at the hotel in Chattanooga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you said all you ought to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried conscientiously to do just that, Poictiers.
I&#8217;ll confess now that I didn&#8217;t begin to see
how dastardly it would look when it was written
out in black on white. But I didn&#8217;t spare myself
in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of an answer do you expect?&#8221;
Carfax had sat down again and his face was
turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t know. Every word that
I have ever told you about the lack of sentiment
between us is true: and yet ... well, Elizabeth
is a woman, after all, Poictiers. Even in a relationship
as unsentimental as ours has been there
are limitations&mdash;there must be limitations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was gazing now into the heart of the
dying fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the case were reversed, Vance, what would
your answer be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon gave a short laugh. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine
the reversal,&#8221; he parried. &#8220;Elizabeth is one of
those splendid, serene, <i>&eacute;lev&eacute;</i> women who go through
life without ever knowing the meaning of a grand
passion.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;Still, you haven&#8217;t answered my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid to answer it. If Elizabeth
had told me, even before I met Richardia, that
she had&mdash; Oh, piffle! it&#8217;s no use; I can&#8217;t imagine
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time Carfax said nothing. But
when the final whiff had been drawn from the
bedtime pipes, he ventured a small request.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been butting in on your affairs so long
that it has come to be a habit, Vance,&#8221; he said,
with his quaint smile. &#8220;When you hear from
Elizabeth, will you tell me what she says?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon, who had been thinking of many
things during the speechless interval, answered
on the impulse of the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; I&#8217;ll let you read the letter, if you
care to. Why shouldn&#8217;t I? There&#8217;s your candle
on the mantel, when you want it. I&#8217;m going to
bed.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX<br />


<small>The Human Equation</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the Tuesday after Tregarvon&#8217;s return
to Coalville the arrival of the new equipment
was the signal for a brisk renewal of the
activities. Tregarvon had spent the day scouring
the valley for men and teams, and by
Wednesday morning he had a small army at his
command. Many hands made light work, and
by noon the machinery was unloaded, and all
was ready for the beginning of the toilsome haul
up the mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you know how you are going to
do it,&#8221; Carfax remarked, dallying over his luncheon
in the office-building dining-room while
Tregarvon was hastily bolting his meal as fast as
Uncle William could serve it. &#8220;Where did you
learn? The university didn&#8217;t teach you, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Experience,&#8221; mumbled the working-man. &#8220;I
learned the trade getting the other boiler and
engine up the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was apparently in a reflective mood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
&#8220;This rough-and-tumble game down here is making
a different man of you,&#8221; he offered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you realize the change?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been afraid of work, if that is what
you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know; but the kind of work that
implies the wearing of corduroys and a flannel
shirt, and builds horny lumps on the palms of
your hands, and makes you talk to a mule in
the only language a mule understands&mdash;I never
used to dream it of you in the old days, Vance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I work for the same reason that other men do&mdash;because
it&#8217;s up to me. This would be a damned
lazy world if necessity didn&#8217;t crack the whip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is again,&#8221; Carfax smiled; &#8220;you even
let bits of the mule language come to the table
with you. It runs in my mind that Elizabeth
is going to have her hands full recivilizing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she won&#8217;t care to. Quite likely she
won&#8217;t need to. If the Ocoee should turn out to
be a real mine with a dividend attachment, it
is altogether probable that I shall become again
what I have been heretofore&mdash;an ornament to
polite society and a wart on the body economic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax shook his head as one who refuses to
be convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will never happen in the wide, wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
world, my dear Vance. We may go around, but
we never go back. I have heard you spoken of,
in times past, as a woman&#8217;s man: you&#8217;ll never be
that again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the kindest thing you&#8217;ve said in a
week,&#8221; Tregarvon averred. Whereupon he bolted
the final mouthful and left the prophet to his own
devices.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, Carfax joined the working
party&mdash;but only as an onlooker. The engine was
mounted on heavy trucks, and a string of twelve
mule-spans was inching it up the mountain pike
to an accompaniment of cracking whips and much
profanity. Tregarvon was in the thick of it, and
the young purse-holder stood aside and tried to
realize that this sweating, bullying gang boss and
man-of-all-work was the light-hearted <i>fl&acirc;neur</i> of
whom his best friends had predicted nothing
either very good or very bad, and certainly nothing
strenuous. Carfax was given to nice weighings
and measurings of the human atom, and he
wondered if the roughing-out process owed anything
to sentimental reactions. Disappointments
are rude tonics to some natures, and defeat in
one field may be the germ of victory in another.
Being a good friend, he proceeded to administer
an additional dose of the tonic, dragging Tregarvon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
aside while the mules were catching their
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like your nerve,&#8221; he began, with the drawl
more than usually pronounced. &#8220;You are taking
up the entire road with your beastly contrivances.
How am I going to get past all this clutter with
the motor-car, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your lookout,&#8221; growled the man-of-all-work.
&#8220;The road is mine while I&#8217;m using it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have an engagement,&#8221; was the mild
protest. &#8220;I&#8217;m to take Richardia out for a drive
after three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t help that, can I? You&#8217;ve got
all the time there is for your courting, and then
some. My job is to get this engine up the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax chuckled softly. &#8220;In another minute
or so you&#8217;ll be mistaking me for one of the mules.
I suppose I can take the other road, from Hesterville;
but as likely as not it will make me late&mdash;it&#8217;s
such a long way around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you send a note up by one of Tryon&#8217;s
boys explaining the situation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear Vance! Can it be possible that
you are suggesting that I should break an engagement
with a young lady?&mdash;you who just a few
weeks ago would have broken your neck to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;Cut it out,&#8221; was the gruff interruption. &#8220;I&#8217;m
busy now, and you are delaying the game. Tag
along behind us when you are ready to drive up,
and we&#8217;ll make room for you if we can.&#8221; Then
to his farmer helpers: &#8220;Now, then&mdash;are you
fellows going to let those mules rest all day?
Push &#8217;em into the collars and let&#8217;s go somewhere!
<i>Hi!</i> you fellows up ahead&mdash;straighten out those
leaders!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cherubic smile was at its shining best when
Carfax turned away and sauntered back toward
the coke-ovens. Human atoms are among the
most interesting things in the world, once the
study of them has passed the elementary stages.
Carfax, deep in the contemplation of the subject,
had reached the ovens themselves before he saw
two men coming toward him, stopping at each
stoke-door to allow the taller of the two to go on
his hands and knees to inspect the cavern-like
interiors. Carfax recognized the shorter of the
pair at once. It was Thaxter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Carfax, shake hands with Mr. Thirlwall,
our consulting engineer&mdash;or rather, you&#8217;d better
not, because his hands are dirty: Mr. Thirlwall,
this is Mr. Poictiers Carfax, Mr. Tregarvon&#8217;s
friend and financial backer.&#8221; Thus the bookkeeper,
when Carfax came up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>Carfax acknowledged the introduction and
shook hands with the tall man, in spite of the
warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delighted,&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;always delighted
to meet any friend of Mr. Thaxter&#8217;s. Tregarvon
is up the road a bit, wrestling with a transportation
problem. Shall I send for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxter negatived the suggestion at once. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t at all necessary to take him away from his
work,&#8221; he protested genially. &#8220;Mr. Thirlwall
was with us for the day, and we thought we would
run down and have a look at your coking-plant.
It&#8217;s in rather bad repair, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now what Carfax did not know about coking-plants
would have filled volumes, but he was
careful not to betray his ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are years of service in these old ovens
yet,&#8221; he asserted confidently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think
so, Mr. Thirlwall? But as to that, we should
expect to put them in good repair if any one
wished to buy them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Tregarvon is still in the mind to sell?&#8221;
queried the round-faced bookkeeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Candidly, Vance doesn&#8217;t know his own mind
from one day to another,&#8221; said Carfax, parrying
nimbly. &#8220;But I guess we are all that way, more
or less; up one day and down the next.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>The tall engineer smiled because it seemed obvious
that he was expected to. &#8220;You have been
having some more bad luck up on the mountain,
so Mr. Thaxter tells me,&#8221; he put in. &#8220;It seems
rather a pity that you and your friend won&#8217;t take
the word of those who know, and stop throwing
good money away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pity, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Carfax concurred heartily.
&#8220;But if we didn&#8217;t spend money in this way,
heaven only knows in what other foolish enterprise
we might be investing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a new power-plant you are hauling
up the hill?&#8221; the engineer inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brand-new,&#8221; boasted Tregarvon&#8217;s proxy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The purchase doesn&#8217;t look as if you were intending
to stop throwing the money away,&#8221; said
Thirlwall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is entirely as it may happen,&#8221; Carfax
countered cheerfully. &#8220;You know the bankrupt
always puts up the best front he can when
he finds himself coming to the jumping-off place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you and Mr. Tregarvon are not trying
to run a bluff on anything so unimpressible as
Consolidated Coal,&#8221; laughed Thaxter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged for the hint,&#8221; returned the
golden youth, accurately matching the bookkeeper&#8217;s
laugh. &#8220;I give you my word, we hadn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
thought of that. Would it astonish you beyond
measure if we should?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try it,&#8221; the engineer advised. &#8220;We
have excellent records of every acre of coal land
in this region, with all the data; thickness of
veins, their placement, and so on. You can&#8217;t
very well run a bluff when the other fellow knows
every card in your hand, Mr. Carfax.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; Carfax yielded gracefully. &#8220;You
people have the age on us, in both meanings of
the word. Have you heard anything from New
York, Mr. Thaxter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing positive, as yet; there has scarcely
been time. But I believe Mr. Thirlwall has been
asked to make a report on the present condition
of the equipment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The engineer confirmed the supposition with
a nod, and Carfax said: &#8220;Tregarvon will be glad
to show you everything he has, I&#8217;m sure. Will
you make the inspection to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thirlwall looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly spare the time this afternoon,&#8221;
he demurred. &#8220;Besides, if I know anything
about such things, Mr. Tregarvon wouldn&#8217;t care
to leave his machinery blocking a public road
while he was showing us around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax had learned all he wished to know, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
now he became urgently hospitable. Wouldn&#8217;t
the visitors stop and rest awhile in the office-building?
True, there was little to offer in the
way of refreshment, but the old negro cook could
make a passable pot of tea. To all of this, Thaxter
made excuses for both and said they must be
driving back to Whitlow.</p>

<p>Carfax let them go, apparently with the greatest
reluctance, walking with them to the post
where Thaxter&#8217;s horse was hitched. But after
the natty side-bar buggy had disappeared over
the small rise in the northward road, he smiled
like an angelic understudy of the villain in a play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, you didn&#8217;t drive down here to tell
us that our coke-ovens are out of repair, Mr.
Thaxter!&#8221; he derided joyously, apostrophizing
the vanished bookkeeper. &#8220;You came to see if
it were really true that we had bought a new engine
and were going on with the game! And you
are jolly well welcome to all that you found out!&#8221;</p>

<p>At a little past two o&#8217;clock, Carfax, driving the
yellow car, tailed in behind the machinery procession
on the mountain road. Tregarvon had
been having good luck and was correspondingly
jubilant; but the sight of Carfax going to keep an
appointment with Richardia Birrell gave him
another set back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; go on and enjoy yourself,&#8221; he
grumbled sourly, as Carfax came up to edge his
way past the obstructing raffle of teams and machinery.
&#8220;If you knew how to chock a wheel or
handle a pinch-bar, I&#8217;d pull you out of that joy
wagon and set you at work. Since you don&#8217;t,
you&#8217;d better trundle along and get out of our
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall tell Miss Richardia that I left you in a
heavenly temper,&#8221; threatened the gentle mocker
in the driving-seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The less you say about me in that quarter,
the better,&#8221; was the surly rejoinder; and with
that, Tregarvon began to shout again at his teamsters.</p>

<p>In due time Carfax negotiated his passage and
the yellow car disappeared in the direction of
Highmount. But the sting was left behind, and
Tregarvon drank deep from the opium cup of
fierce labor without being able to purchase blessed
oblivion. Jagged thoughts came uppermost; repinings
as old as mankind; as venerable, at least,
as that prehistoric day when the first friend took
it upon himself to smite his brother into the
straight and narrow path.</p>

<p>Why must civilized man, alone of all sentient
beings, be burdened with that inconsiderate thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
called conscience? The bird of the air, the beast
of the field, was free to choose its mate; the savage
stood aside only when some bigger savage
compelled him. Environment and the stress of
the moment have shaping influences mighty in
proportion to the strenuosities. Tregarvon, fighting
for the up-hill inches with a load a ton or so
heavier than his pulling power, became immune
to the gentler leadings. Why should a promise,
made to a woman who had taken it serenely as a
conventional matter of course, stand in the way
of a passion so vital that it laid hold upon the
very well-springs of life? Why should he stand
aside and let Carfax, under a fantastic sense of
duty, mar three lives, or possibly four, in a foolish
attempt to preserve the conventional unities?</p>

<p>The materialistic afternoon had done its worst
for Tregarvon by the time Tryon&#8217;s boy, who had
been stationed on ahead to give warning of the
approach of descending teams, waved his hat as
a signal that some one was driving down the
mountain. The moment was inauspicious. A
pulling-rope had just broken; the heavy load of
machinery was stalled in a crooked bend in the
road, and was for the time immovable. Tregarvon
yelped out a string of orders to his helpers,
and then went on past the tangle of mules and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
rope tackle to meet the descending vehicle.
Being in the proper frame of mind, he swore
crabbedly to the world at large when he saw that
it was his own car, with Carfax at the wheel,
Richardia in the mechanician&#8217;s seat, and the tonneau
thickly packed with young women from
Highmount.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t pass,&#8221; was his curt denial of the
right of way when Carfax slowed to a stop. &#8220;We
have just broken a tackle, and everything is all
balled up. Couldn&#8217;t you find any other road to
drive on?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax laughed and turned to his seat-mate.
&#8220;You see how inhospitable he really is when he
isn&#8217;t parading his company manners.&#8221; Then to
the young women behind him: &#8220;Mr. Tregarvon
won&#8217;t let us drive down, but if you young ladies
would care to see the wheels go round at a moment
when, as it seems, they have just stopped going
round, we can walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an instant chorus of walking votes,
and Carfax got out to open the tonneau door.
Tregarvon stood aside, scowling as any working-boss
might when his difficulties are about to be
made a raree-show for the frivolous. Miss Richardia
slipped out of the mechanician&#8217;s seat on
her own side of the car, unassisted, but when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
sight-seeing contingent marshalled itself for the
descent into the tangle, she did not join it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going with the others?&#8221; said Tregarvon
ungraciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are enough of them for you to be spiteful
at, without adding me to the number,&#8221; she
returned, adding: &#8220;Besides, I wanted to speak
to you. It was I who asked Mr. Carfax to drive
down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had come around to his side of the car and
he looked her squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful what you say to me to-day, Richardia:
I am not the same man that I was a few
days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boo!</i>&#8221; she said, with the little grimace that
always set his blood afire; &#8220;you make me shivery
when you look and talk that way. I came to try
to help you&mdash;not to be frozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it,&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I, when you won&#8217;t let me? I have
a piece of news for you&mdash;something that I imagine
you&#8217;d like to know. Have you written to Miss
Wardwell lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Sunday night in Chattanooga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is Wednesday: have you had a
reply?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not yet. What is your news?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>&#8220;I was just wondering whether I&#8217;d better not
keep it to myself, after all. Mr. Carfax said you
were in a bad temper, but he didn&#8217;t tell me that
you were utterly impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s scowl deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible? Of course, I am impossible.
What would you expect, in the circumstances?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, she smiled up at him and said: &#8220;I&#8217;m
beginning to be a little deaf now&mdash;charitably
deaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need charity,&#8221; he broke out hotly.
&#8220;All I need is a chance to fight for my own hand.
Tell me one thing: have you promised to marry
Poictiers yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any right to ask me such a question
as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have; the best right in the world: you know
I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>She met his half-angry, half-passionate gaze
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you are about to make a shipwreck
of your better self,&#8221; she averred. Then:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that there are some things that
are hard for a woman to forgive&mdash;or, having forgiven
them, to forget?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in no mood to split hairs with you
to-day,&#8221; he grated. &#8220;You are thinking of Elizabeth:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
she knows already what she will have to
forgive. I told her in the letter I wrote Sunday
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are tearing the anchors loose, one by
one. Will nothing make you realize what you
are doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have me do? It has come
to that, Richardia: I don&#8217;t care for anything else.
A little further along, you may be another man&#8217;s
wife, and I may be another woman&#8217;s husband;
but it will make no difference&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t!</i>&#8221; she cried sharply; and then, before
he could add another word, she had left him and
was walking down the road to meet the tonneau
party which was stringing along on its return to
the car, with Carfax in the lead.</p>

<p>Tregarvon tramped moodily away when Carfax
began to help his charges into the car, going
back to the tangle which Tryon had finally contrived
to straighten out. Taking over the command,
he flung himself once more into the work,
but the fine fire was gone, and when evening came
and the machinery truck was left blocked at the
roadside to wait for another day, he trudged back
to Coalville at the tail of the mule cavalcade,
sodden with weariness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>Carfax had not returned when Uncle William
served dinner, and Tregarvon ate alone, morosely
thankful for the solitude. Afterward he went
directly to his room on the second floor; and Carfax,
coming in a little after nine o&#8217;clock, had no
chance to tell him of Thaxter&#8217;s visit and its probable
object.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX<br />


<small>Limitations</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAY following day in the conflict with steepness
on the mountain road, Tregarvon
toiled early and late, breakfasting before Carfax
was visible, eating at midday out of a basket
brought to the scene of the activities by Uncle
William, and missing the golden youth two evenings
in succession by reason of Carfax&#8217;s continued
popularity at Highmount.</p>

<p>Such sacrifices to the morose deities of materialism
bring their own revenges. By the Friday
evening, when the new engine and boiler had been
dragged painfully up the final ascent and had been
halted for the night at a point nearly opposite
the college campus, Tregarvon had become a
bitter man-driver and was facing the consequences
in a strike on the part of his farmer helpers.</p>

<p>John Teppenpaw, a husky young Wehatcheean
from the farther side of the valley who had brought
four of the best-pulling beasts to the job, was the
first to raise the standard of revolt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef you-all &#8217;ll thess pay me off, I reckon I won&#8217;t
come back no more,&#8221; Teppenpaw announced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
after he had thrown the trace-chains over the
backs of his mules for the descent of the mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&mdash;what the devil is the matter
with <i>you</i>?&#8221; Tregarvon snapped viciously. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
you getting enough money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money ain&#8217;t the onliest thing ther&#8217; is in this
world,&#8221; was the sullen retort. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t allowin&#8217;
to let no man hire me to take his cussin&#8217; and
swearin&#8217; and browbeatin&#8217;. I got a li&#8217;l piece o&#8217;
land and a few head o&#8217; stock o&#8217; my own, and I
allow I don&#8217;t <i>haf</i> to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s about the size of it f&#8217;r me,
too,&#8221; put in Jeff Daggett, who was Teppenpaw&#8217;s
nearest neighbor on the north; and from this the
fire of resentment spread so rapidly that the
strike became unanimous, passing at once beyond
any hope of arbitration.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quitting on me before the job&#8217;s finished?&#8221;
raged Tregarvon. &#8220;You are a lot of
bally idiots! The money you are getting for this
haul is more than any one of you will see from
now to Christmas! Are you a pack of silly women
that you can&#8217;t stand a little man-sized talk from
a boss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jist hit,&#8221; said Daggett. &#8220;Looks like
you-all was used to rippin&#8217; and tearin&#8217; at them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
no-account furriners up No&#8217;th that ain&#8217;t got
nothin&#8217;, and don&#8217;t know enough to raise a terruction
when you cuss &#8217;em out. We-all ain&#8217;t nuther
niggers n&#8217;r furriners. I&#8217;ll take my pay and quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon became heavily sarcastic. &#8220;Is this
your way of telling me that you want more
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bickler, the oldest man in the squad, made
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you-all ain&#8217;t got money enough to
make us-all come back f&#8217;r another day like what
this&#8217;n has been, Mr. Tregarvon. You&#8217;ve got a
heap to l&#8217;arn ef ye allow to stay down yere in old
Tennessee and get white men to work f&#8217;r ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit, then, and be damned to you!&#8221; Tregarvon
exploded. &#8220;Show up at the office in Coalville
to-morrow morning before I leave, and you&#8217;ll
get your pay. I don&#8217;t carry your money around
with me in my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>To a clattering of hoofs and a jingling of trace-chains
the cavalcade moved off down the pike,
leaving the deserted boss standing beside the
stranded machinery truck. Tregarvon knew very
well that by another day the story of the strike
and its cause would be passed from lip to ear
throughout the length and breadth of the Wehatchee,
and there would be no hope of recruiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
another gang among the farmers. The half-mile
of sandy wood road still remained to be traversed,
and without the teams the load could be moved
only by means of a block and tackle and winch,
manned by Tryon&#8217;s gang of track laborers; a
process which would add other exasperating days
of delay.</p>

<p>The dusk was thickening under the trees when
the discouraged hauling-boss took his coat from
the truck and struggled into it preparatory to
setting out upon the long tramp down the mountain.
He had seen nothing of Carfax since an
hour before noon, when the yellow car had edged
past the road obstructions on its way up the pike.
But now he heard the purring of a motor and
waited.</p>

<p>The car was coming down the cross-mountain
road, and Tregarvon could see that there were
two persons in it. Instead of turning in at the
campus gates, it came on, and Carfax braked it
to a stop opposite the loaded truck. &#8220;Is that
you, Vance?&#8221; he called to the figure standing in
the shadow of the pines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Tregarvon stepped out of the shadows
and crossed to the automobile, though the nearer
approach was not needed to assure him that Carfax&#8217;s
companion was Richardia Birrell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;You are coming along beautifully!&#8221; Carfax
praised, speaking as one who holds himself delicately
aloof from the toilsome details. &#8220;It&#8217;s
great to be a working-man and able to do things.
One day more will take you over to the drilling
ground, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half a day was all I asked, with the men and
teams; but I am not going to have it. They have
quit on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A strike? What was the trouble? Weren&#8217;t
you paying them enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a question of more money. They
seemed to think that I ought to speak softly and
say &#8216;mister&#8217; and &#8216;please&#8217; when I wanted them to
get a move.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax laughed and turned to his companion
in the other half of the driving-seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;He puts it rather&mdash;er&mdash;diplomatically, don&#8217;t
you think?&#8221; he confided to the young woman.
&#8220;Really, you know, his language has come to be
something frightful!&#8221; Then to the diplomat:
&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon ignored Carfax&#8217;s companion, and
the derisive confidence to which she had made
no reply. &#8220;If I had the nerve, I suppose I might
kill another week dragging the thing through the
wood by half-inches with a block and tackle and
man-power,&#8221; he offered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;Dear me! And in the meantime the enemy&mdash;whoever
he is&mdash;will be storing up ammunition
and getting ready to efface you once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I shall give &#8216;the enemy&#8217; another
chance at me. Will you be down to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hold on; don&#8217;t go off in a huff that way!&#8221;
Carfax protested in mock concern. &#8220;We have
had our little joy-ride, and I was just taking Miss
Richardia home. Wait a minute and tell us
how you are going to block &#8216;the enemy&#8217;s&#8217; game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was still ignoring Miss Birrell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thaxter sent me a note this morning. Consolidated
Coal is ready to do business with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With you, you mean; I am only a good-natured
bystander. What does Mr. Thaxter
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time in the brisk exchange of question
and answer, Tregarvon took the silent member
of the trio into consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this doesn&#8217;t interest Miss Richardia. I
can talk the business matter over with you later
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the music teacher had been keeping a vow
of silence she broke it now with a little laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am interested,&#8221; she assured him; adding:
&#8220;I hope you feel better, now that you have made
me say it in so many words.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>Tregarvon let the small gibe go without retort.</p>

<p>&#8220;The offer of a hundred thousand for the Ocoee
properties has been renewed in my behalf, Thaxter
tells me; but if I wish to avail myself of it,
I must accept immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the keen rush?&#8221; Carfax inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is explained reasonably enough. The C. C.
&amp; I. people are preparing to open other veins on
their Whitlow lands to the north of the present
mine. These plans are being held up, pending
my decision. If I sell out to them, they will
probably abandon these plans for the present;
opening, instead, the south vein&mdash;the one Thaxter
told us about&mdash;and using our tramway and coke-ovens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax seemed to have grown suddenly reflective.
&#8220;It rather puts you between two fires,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he commented. &#8220;You don&#8217;t wish
to lose your chance to sell, and you don&#8217;t wish
to sell before you have seen what that unfinished
hole over yonder may be going to show you.
And if you take time to drag this power-plant
over by hand, the golden opportunity will get by.
The question which suggests itself to me is a very
foolish one, no doubt. I&#8217;m asking myself how
much the C. C. &amp; I. people paid your farmers to
induce them to lie down on you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>Tregarvon&#8217;s laugh was brittle. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
go that far. I&#8217;ll be frank enough to admit that
I gave Daggett and his men plenty of provocation
for the strike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, you&#8217;ve been handing them
some of the mule talk. Shocking! But that is
spilt milk and it can&#8217;t be gathered up now.
What is Thaxter&#8217;s time limit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says in his note that he will expect to hear
from me by Saturday, at the latest. That is to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, Miss Richardia spoke up quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Does &#8216;to-morrow&#8217; mean all day to-morrow?
Or does it mean to-morrow morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I should suppose I might take the day
for it. Any option holds good up to midnight
of its day of expiration, unless there is some proviso
to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how long would it take you to do all these
things that Mr. Carfax says you would like to do
first&mdash;before deciding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few hours, if the men and teams had
stayed with me. But as it is, it would probably
take a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment and then Carfax
said: &#8220;Miss Richardia is trying to tell you to
postpone your decision as long as you can, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
she can&#8217;t find the words. That is my advice, too.
One can never tell what a day may bring forth.
Wait a minute until I can drive back to the college,
and then I&#8217;ll take you down the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon stood aside while Carfax turned the
car and sent it swiftly up to and through the
Highmount gateway. A few minutes later the
golden youth came sauntering back, alone and
afoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That blessed motor of yours has gone dippy
again,&#8221; he announced coolly, as if the yellow car
had lately been acquiring bad habits. &#8220;It pegged
out just as I drove up to the Caswell door. I suppose
I shall have to send a boy over to our shack
after Rucker. Mrs. Caswell rises to the occasion
and invites us both to dinner while we wait.
What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on your life!&#8221; Tregarvon refused sourly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not fit company for anybody to-night. I&#8217;ll
walk down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right: then I&#8217;ll stay and bring the car
after Rucker has rejuvenated it. You needn&#8217;t
sit up for me. And, by the way, that reminds me.
There were some letters for you last night&mdash;Tait
brought them over after you had gone to bed.
Did you find them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I got them this morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>&#8220;Anything from&mdash;er&mdash;from Elizabeth yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet; no.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax hesitated a moment and then interested
himself sympathetically&mdash;or seemed to. &#8220;I hope
you didn&#8217;t say too much&mdash;or too little&mdash;in that
confession of yours last Sunday night, Vance; in
the letter you sent from Chattanooga.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I suppose I am, as you might say&mdash;er&mdash;well,
I&#8217;m a sort of an accessory before the
fact, don&#8217;t you think? I can&#8217;t forget that it
was I who clubbed you into the proper frame of
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry; you&#8217;re safely out of it,&#8221;
declared the confessor, with a laugh which was
only half good-natured. &#8220;I gave you your just
due: told her that I owed you my soul&#8217;s salvation;
which you had safely clinched against any
backsliding by asking Richardia to marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence like that
which precedes the crash of summer thunder.
Then, in a still, small voice, Carfax said: &#8220;You
told her that, did you? You gave her to understand
that, right off the bat, and merely in passing,
as it were, I had carelessly determined to
marry your temptation out of your way? There
was only one mistake made in your education,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Vance; the person who first taught you to put
pen to paper ought to have been instantly hanged,
drawn and quartered. I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; but here, apparently,
speech failed him, and he turned abruptly
to walk rapidly away toward Highmount, leaving
Tregarvon standing, half-remorseful and wholly
bewildered, in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>The bewilderment went with the too highly
educated one a good part of the way down to
Coalville, and it certainly would have been increased
if he could have known that, five minutes
after he had turned the first curve in the winding
pike below Highmount, the car which had been
so lately reported out of commission had been
mysteriously restored to a state of usefulness;
that, with a man and a woman in the driving-seat,
it had whisked through the campus portal,
cut a perilous quarter-circle at speed in the piked
roadway, and had vanished in a thick cloud of
limestone dust to the westward, leaving Mrs.
Caswell&#8217;s dinner to wait for its return.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI<br />


<small>The Clansmen</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TREGARVON turned out early in the morning
of a Saturday, to be known afterward
as a day of fateful happenings, largely from force
of habit&mdash;since there was no mule cavalcade to be
led to the Pisgah heights. As on the three previous
mornings, he breakfasted alone. In reply
to his inquiry, Uncle William told him that the
motor-car was not in its shed, and the inference
was that Carfax had spent the night as the guest
of the Caswells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Summa dem po&#8217; white men out yondeh on de
po&#8217;ch a-waitin&#8217; faw you-all, Mistoo Tregarbin,&#8221;
the old negro announced, after the solitary meal
was despatched. &#8220;Look lak dey&#8217;s mighty grumptious
erbout somepin, dey does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon went to the front of the building,
where he had established a rude excuse for an
office, and opened the door. The farmers were
there, waiting for their pay, and the settlement
was made without waste of words on either side.
But after the money had been handed out, Daggett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
was moved to make peaceful overtures,
natural kindliness having gotten the better of resentment.
They&mdash;the farmers&mdash;had been talking
it over among themselves, and Daggett &#8220;allowed&#8221;
that they might have been hasty. Without prejudice
to the fact that they objected to being sworn
at, they would come back Monday or Tuesday
of the following week and finish the hauling job,
if the boss so desired.</p>

<p>At this, as was most natural after a night of
worry and disappointment, Tregarvon&#8217;s temper
flew into shards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in a hundred years, you won&#8217;t!&#8221; he exploded
wrathfully. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t move that machinery
without your help, it may stand right
where it is until it rots! You&#8217;ve got your money,
and I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. We&#8217;re quits.&#8221; And
with that he shouldered his way through the group
and went to rally Tryon and the track gang,
marshalling the handful of laborers for the ascent
of the mountain in the tram-car.</p>

<p>Some half-hour beyond this, the handful having
taken a short-cut through the summit forest
from the tramhead, Tregarvon found a sharp surprise
awaiting him at the point on the pike where
the truck load had been halted for the night.
Scattered along the road or drawn up under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
trees were a dozen or more teams of all sorts and
descriptions&mdash;raw-boned mules in mismatched
pairs, spans in which an ancient horse was harnessed
with a mule or with another horse to the
full as venerable, animals with back-bones like
ridge-poles, others posturing as the halt, the lame,
and the blind, and, completing the makeshifts, a
wagon drawn by a pair of diminutive bulls. The
drivers of this new levy were harmoniously in
keeping with their outworn stock, decrepit wagons,
and rope-patched harnesses; lank, sallow-faced
mountain men of the McNabb type, with a toothless
patriarch of the McNabb name to act as
their spokesman.</p>

<p>&#8220;We-uns done heerd you-uns wuz a-needin&#8217;
holp fer to pull thish-yer load thoo the woods,&#8221;
said the aged spokesman, shrilling in a high,
cracked voice at Tregarvon. &#8220;Me an&#8217; th&#8217; boys
&#8217;lowed we&#8217;d drap erlong an&#8217; gin ye a h&#8217;ist. How-all
does ye hitch on ter that thar kintraption?&#8221;
with a thumb-jerk over his shoulder toward the
loaded truck.</p>

<p>Tregarvon recovered from his surprise in a rebound
of heartfelt thankfulness. Here was manna
from the skies, indeed. He asked no questions;
made no ungrateful effort to pry into the whys
and wherefores of the miracle. It was enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
that the gods had relented. Treading softly
among the adjectives, he proceeded to set his
curiously assorted helpers, man and beast, in
order, and the advance was begun.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the task ran smoothly, despite
the makeshift pulling beasts and the prodigious
inexperience of the drivers with any load so formidable
as the engine-mounted truck. To offset
the inexperience, there was a quiet and resolute
willingness that was heart-warming after the exacerbating
sullenness of the valley farmers. Tregarvon
found that his normal good-nature had
not been slain; it had only been pushed aside;
discovered also that hard words may make hard
work. Turning the new leaf handsomely, he let
the agile old patriarch do the bossing, and thus,
rod by rod, the sandy half-mile was traversed
and the goal in the old burying-ground was
reached.</p>

<p>Just before noon, when the truck load had been
pushed and pulled and inched into place in the
glade, Carfax turned up, walking across from the
school. His congratulations were profuse, but if
he knew anything about the manner of the miracle-working,
he betrayed neither himself nor the
secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was certain you&#8217;d find a way out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
strike trouble,&#8221; he asserted blandly. &#8220;I told the
folks at the dinner-table last evening that I had
never seen you knocked out so completely that
you were obliged to take the count. How did
you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon shook his head. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it;
it was done for me. When I came up this morning
with Tryon and the trackmen, the teams were
ready and waiting. Somebody had rounded them
up for me during the night. I have been charging
it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s laugh was a sufficient negation of the
charge. &#8220;Do I look it?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;If I
do, I can prove an <i>alibi</i>. I spent a very pleasant
evening with the Caswells and a bunch of the
senior girls, and I am reasonably sure that I
didn&#8217;t walk in my sleep afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Richardia go home for the week-end, as
usual?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did; though she stayed and took dinner
with us at Highmount. I drove her over to Westwood
House in the car, later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the car is all right again, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; there wasn&#8217;t much the matter with
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tryon had taken over the bossing of the gang,
with Rucker for his able second, and Tregarvon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
was free to stand aside and talk with Carfax about
the miracle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say Richardia went home after dinner?&#8221;
he queried. Then: &#8220;I can&#8217;t help thinking that
this is her doing. These men are all mountaineers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s chuckle was frankly derisive. &#8220;That
is mere sentiment on your part; the wish the
father to the thought. You&#8217;d rather like to feel
that you are indebted to her, wouldn&#8217;t you? But
I shall have to spoil that little day-dream. She
was with the rest of us at Highmount until after
ten o&#8217;clock, and it must have been nearly eleven
when I drove her over to Westwood House&mdash;much
too late to begin any campaign of team-raising
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon took this apparent evidence of Miss
Richardia&#8217;s non-complicity at its face value, but
he was still shaking his head dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it, Poictiers. These
McNabbs and their cousins might very properly
have it in for me on the old score of the land lawsuit;
and, as you know, we have been suspecting
them, more or less, all along. But now they
turn out to give me a lift, just as I am about to
lose my grip. What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s grin was as nearly impish as his cherubic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
semblance would permit. &#8220;Call it an attack
of conscience,&#8221; he suggested playfully. &#8220;The
other night we decided that it was one of the
McNabbs who put the dynamite into the old
boiler. Perhaps they have all had a change
of heart, and this is their way of showing it.
Will you be ready to go on drilling this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid not. We shall have the machinery
unloaded in another hour or so, and I can let
these outsiders go home. But it will take the remainder
of the day to get the engine in working
order, so Rucker says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the C. C. &amp; I. buying offer? The
option expires with to-day, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon turned quickly upon the questioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you advise me to take the offer, Poictiers?
You will remember that after our talk with Hartridge
a week ago you said I was not to sell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but only idiots and corpses are unable
to change their minds. You owe it to your
people at home not to fall between two stools.
After all is said, a sure hundred thousand is better
than nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hartridge has been working on you again,&#8221;
said Tregarvon accusingly. &#8220;And this time he
has taken the other tack. Isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>Carfax neither admitted nor denied a later talk
with the schoolmaster. &#8220;He asserts positively
that you will find the two thin veins again here,
with the rock between. He ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was silenced for the moment. Then
he broke out impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to know for myself, Poictiers. If I
don&#8217;t stay with it long enough to prove up, I shall
be a quitter. I&#8217;m all the other things you have
occasionally called me, but not that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I know you are not. I was just thinking:
if you could meet Thaxter and talk with
him? Possibly you could get the option time
extended for a few days. You have a good reason
for asking&mdash;apart from the real one, which is to
find out what this drill-hole is going to say to you.
You might urge that you&#8217;d like to have time to
communicate with your lawyers. Suppose we
drive up to Whitlow this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; Tregarvon conceded. &#8220;It is barely
possible that we shall get the drill in operation
again to-day, and in that case I shall know definitely
what to do. Do you lunch at Highmount?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; laughed the golden youth. &#8220;The Caswells
have adopted me, and I shall get square with
them a little further along by financing the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
gymnasium. How about paying this miracle
gang? Have you money enough with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t, and I was going to ask if you would
drive down to the office and break into the safe
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do better than that,&#8221; said the money-finder,
producing a thick roll of bank-notes.
&#8220;Money is the one thing I&#8217;m rotten with. I must
go back and report for luncheon now, but I&#8217;ll be
over again later on, and we can decide about the
trip to Whitlow.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short time after Carfax&#8217;s departure, Tregarvon
paid the mountaineers and let them go.
Singularly enough, some of the volunteers did not
wish to take money and had to be persuaded.
The sums named were ridiculously small, and in
each instance Tregarvon gave more than was
asked, putting the larger wage on the ground of
the value of the service to him.</p>

<p>In the settlement the beneficiary of the miracle
made an attempt to find out to whom the timely
help was owing, but the effort spent itself against
a dead wall of mountaineer reticence&mdash;or unknowledge.
The McNabb patriarch had &#8220;heerd&#8221; of
the trouble with the valley farmers through &#8220;ol&#8217;
man Kent&#8221;; Kent had got the word from somebody
else; and so it went, with the first cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
either unknown or carefully concealed. Tregarvon
did not press too curiously for the explanation.
It was too much like inquiring the age of the proverbial
gift-horse.</p>

<p>After the noon halt, with the glade cleared of
the men and teams, the work of installation was
begun. For a time it progressed handsomely.
Rucker and Tryon were both competent foremen,
and by three o&#8217;clock they had the engine and
boiler shifted from the truck to its place behind
the drill derrick, with only the steam-pipe connections
remaining to be made.</p>

<p>Carfax had not yet returned, and Tregarvon
began to wonder if he had forgotten the proposed
Whitlow expedition. By this time it seemed altogether
probable that the drilling could be resumed
within an hour or two, and the mining
gambler&#8217;s passion to stay in the game until the
last card had been turned fought against cool-headed
prudence for first place in the struggle
Tregarvon was making to decide as to what he
should do.</p>

<p>If he should leave the mountain before the drilling
began, the uncertainties would still be unresolved.
On the other hand, if Consolidated
Coal meant to hold him rigidly to the terms of
the option, it became crucially necessary that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
should know in advance what this final drilling-test
was going to prove. If it should prove only
another failure, the opportunity to sell must not
be allowed to lapse. But if the test should prove
that he had at last discovered the workable
mother-vein.... Tregarvon gasped at the golden
possibility, and the offer of a paltry tenth of a
million shrank to nothing.</p>

<p>He was wishing, for the hundredth time, that
Carfax would come and help him to decide, when
a buggy drawn by a high-stepping black horse appeared
among the trees on the opposite side of the
glade. Tregarvon recognized the equipage at
once. It was Thaxter&#8217;s, and the round-bodied
bookkeeper was alone. The victim of indecision
pulled himself together quickly. Chance, or the
kindlier gods, had given him his opportunity,
and he meant to improve it.</p>

<p>Thaxter came across to the tool shanty with the
Cheeryble smile in commission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still spending your good money on the kite-flying,
are you?&#8221; he said, with a jerk of his thumb
over his shoulder at the new power-plant. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know as I can blame you so very much:
I was young and enthusiastic once, myself.
You&#8217;ve worked wonders getting that thing up
the mountain in such a short time. Somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
told me you were hung up with a strike, or something
of the sort, and as it was our Saturday half-holiday,
I thought I&#8217;d drive up and condole with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon offered the bookkeeper a seat on the
shanty step, saying: &#8220;We were hung up, temporarily,
but we are getting into shape now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; returned the jovial little man; and
for a space the talk ran upon the difficulties of
mountain installations and the drawbacks of having
to depend upon picked-up labor in a region
where labor was scarce. After a time, Thaxter
broached the option matter of his own accord.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got my note the other day, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Promptly,&#8221; Tregarvon acknowledged. &#8220;I
was planning to go to Whitlow this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you changed your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have changed it now, since you have been
good enough to drive up. I suppose we can talk
here as well as in your office. I have been considering
the offer to purchase, and on some accounts
it is rather attractive. We all like to bet
on a sure thing when we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The genial go-between chuckled sagely. &#8220;And,
on the other hand, we all like to bet upon the
possibilities, now and then,&#8221; he thrust in. &#8220;If
you only had any possibilities&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>Tregarvon made haste to fight away from that
phase of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll disregard the possibilities, which I may
believe in, and you don&#8217;t, Mr. Thaxter. This
new power outfit was bought before I had your
letter, and since we had it, we could hardly do less
than to go on and install it. Let that part of it
go, and we&#8217;ll attack the business affair. As I
say, I have been considering Consolidated Coal&#8217;s
offer to buy me out. Since you are buying nothing
but the equipment, the offer is fair enough.
But my father&#8217;s estate is concerned, and the
option is too short. In common prudence, I
ought to consult my lawyers, and there hasn&#8217;t
been time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The small man shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;These matters are all decided for us by the
big fellows in New York,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;In my
letter I gave you the reasons why they have put
the hurry speed on in this particular instance.
It is really a very small detail to Consolidated
Coal whether it buys you out or doesn&#8217;t buy
you out&mdash;merely a pen-scratch in the day&#8217;s work.
Of course, you know that, as well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Tregarvon admitted. &#8220;But in spite of
that, I am going to ask you to take it up with the
powers again, suggesting that they give me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
little more time. A few days, more or less, can
make no difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the bookkeeper shook his head more
firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be risking my poor little job, Mr.
Tregarvon. I am only the humblest of under-strappers
in the big corporation, and if I should
try to pull strings for you, some nippy chief clerk
in the New York offices would tell me to pack my
grip and get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then supposing you turn the papers over to
me and let me do my own bargaining with headquarters,&#8221;
Tregarvon ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do a particle of good, as you&#8217;d
know if you had had any dealings with the great
corporations. These things are mere matters of
routine, and you couldn&#8217;t break that routine with
a sledge-hammer, Mr. Tregarvon. I&#8217;m awfully
sorry, but I am afraid the option will have to
stand as it was made&mdash;to expire at midnight to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon had one small shot in reserve and
the time had arrived when it must be fired.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that view of the case, Mr. Thaxter, I am
afraid I shall have to stay out,&#8221; he said, hoping
against hope that the shot might find its target.</p>

<p>Once more Thaxter made the sign of regretful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
negation. From where he was sitting the bookkeeper
had a fair view of the installation activities,
and Tregarvon could not help wondering if their
rapid progress toward completion had anything
to do with Thaxter&#8217;s immovability. While he
was waiting for the bluffing shot to penetrate, if
it would, Rucker came across from the new engine,
carrying a piece of iron pipe with a valve
attached; carrying, also, a ferocious scowl to
emphasize his complaint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them machinery guys over in Chattanooga
is a fright!&#8221; he rapped out. &#8220;That boiler dome is
tapped for inch-and-a-quarter pipe, and so&#8217;s the
engine; and they&#8217;ve gone and sent us this inch-and-a-half
throttle and pipe connection! Wot
t&#8217; &#8217;ell am I goin&#8217; to do about that, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon grasped the new obstacle&mdash;and his
own fierce impatience&mdash;firmly by the neck and
refused to make a profane show of himself for
Thaxter&#8217;s benefit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there is only one thing to do, Billy;
to go down to the railroad office and wire the
machinery people to make good,&#8221; he answered
placably. Then to Thaxter: &#8220;We have hit so
many of these knock-outs that we are beginning
to learn that we must take them as they come.&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
And with that, he scribbled a telegram on a leaf
of his note-book, tore it out, and gave it to
Rucker.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the message,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell Tryon
and the men that the jig is up for to-day, and
that I&#8217;ll be down a little later on to pay them off.
You&#8217;d better go down yourself and send that
wire. If you can persuade the railroad agent to
hustle it, we may catch the machinery shop before
it closes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thaxter sat quite silent during the dispersal of
the working gang; did not speak again until
after the last of the men had disappeared in the
direction of the tramhead. Then he said: &#8220;Well,
you are hung up until next week safely enough
now. Your wire won&#8217;t get an answer this late
Saturday afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; Tregarvon agreed. &#8220;The
order will be filled Monday, and the new throttle
will get here Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday,
at the pleasure of the railroad people.
Cheerful layout, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly have bad luck enough to discourage
most young men,&#8221; said the bookkeeper,
as one who would not withhold sympathy where
sympathy is due. &#8220;Do you know, it simply
grinds me to be the one to add my bit to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
aggregation. I&#8217;ve half a mind to take a chance
on the thunder and lightning and ask New York
for that extension of time for you. You might
reasonably hope to hear from your Philadelphia
attorneys by Monday or Tuesday, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon snatched at the concession avidly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll wire them to-night,&#8221; he promised, as if his
decision depended entirely upon the result of
the long-range consultation. But after Thaxter
had driven away, excusing his haste on the plea
that no time must be lost in reaching a telegraph
office, Tregarvon wondered again; this time half-suspiciously.
Why had Thaxter changed his tune
so suddenly? Was it because he had just been
given ocular proof that the test-drilling was again
postponed? The more Tregarvon thought of it,
the more plausible the assumption grew; and he
was almost ready to call it a fact when, an hour
later, Carfax put in an appearance with the
motor-car.</p>

<p>In a few words Tregarvon told the story of the
afternoon&#8217;s happenings, giving the suspicion due
standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only a guess, as usual,&#8221; he offered in conclusion.
&#8220;But, in any event, the strain is off for
the present. Thaxter will get the extension, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
in the meantime we can take our chance to draw
a comfortable breath or two. After Rucker
comes back, we&#8217;ll go down the hill and get ready
to enjoy an old-fashioned restful Sunday. I don&#8217;t
mind confessing that the strain has been getting
next to me, Poictiers. I&#8217;m going to push the
whole wretched tangle into the background, for
one day, at least, and try to catch up with my
nerve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good medicine!&#8221; laughed the one who had
no nerves; and Rucker returning a few minutes
later to resume his duties as resident watchman,
they climbed into the yellow car and Tregarvon
took the wheel to drive to the valley.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII<br />


<small>Out of a Clear Sky</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE event of the day for Coalville&mdash;the arrival
of the afternoon passenger-train from
Chattanooga&mdash;was in the near prospect when the
yellow car rolled down the last of the grades and
swept a wide circle around the coke-ovens and
past the unloading platforms.</p>

<p>The train-time signs were always unmistakable.
A little while before the hour, and always
as if warned by some signal inaudible to alien
ears, the loungers under Tait&#8217;s porch rose, shook
their legs to settle wrinkled trousers, and filed
slowly over to the railroad station. Tregarvon&#8217;s
motor-car, no longer a nine days&#8217; wonder to the
army of leisure, was slowing to cross the rails of
the Ocoee siding when the station agent ran out
of his office to wave the motorists down with a
telegram. The message was for Carfax, and the
agent explained that it had been delayed in transmission
by some trouble with the wire on the
branch line.</p>

<p>While Carfax was opening the envelope, Tregarvon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
got out and went around to see if the brakes
had been running cool in the swift drop from the
summit of Pisgah. For this cause he did not hear
Carfax&#8217;s, &#8220;Ye gods and little fishes!&#8221; basing itself
upon a glance at the delayed telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vance!&#8221; he called, turning in his place to
see what had become of Tregarvon. But Tregarvon
did not hear. A canopy-topped surrey,
venerable with age and drawn by a great-boned
horse of dapple gray, was turning out of the
Hesterville road to cross the tracks to the station.
Miss Richardia Birrell was holding the
reins over the dapple gray, and in the seat beside
her was an old man, erect, white-haired, handsome
as an ancestral portrait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jehu!&#8221; said Tregarvon under his breath.
&#8220;So that is her father. If looks count for anything,
he is worthy of her; which is more than I
would say for any other Tennesseean I&#8217;ve met.&#8221;
Then Carfax&#8217;s anxious call was repeated, and
this time Tregarvon answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not lost&mdash;only mislaid,&#8221; he returned. Then
he saw Carfax&#8217;s face: &#8220;Why, Poictiers!&mdash;who is
dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was standing up in his place, clinging
to the steering-wheel with one hand and waving
the telegram like a flag of distress in the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>&#8220;Read that!&#8221; he commanded tragically, when
the inspector of brakes came within passing
reach.</p>

<p>Tregarvon glanced at the message and became,
in his turn, a man stricken down without warning.
The bolt was dated at Chattanooga, and it had
been filed for sending at nine in the forenoon. It
was addressed to Carfax, and it read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Here with papa and mamma, and the Pennsylvania
battle-monument dedicators. If I should
run over to Coalville with Clotilde this afternoon,
will you and Vance put me up at the hotel and
show me your mine? But, of course, you will.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, good heavens!&#8221; groaned Tregarvon, when
the paralyzing effect of the announcement gave
place to the panic of dismay; &#8220;E-Elizabeth and
her maid?&mdash;coming here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax laughed rather wildly. &#8220;Yes; coming
here to stop at&mdash;at the hotel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon read the message again. &#8220;She says
&#8216;this afternoon.&#8217; That means to-day&mdash;now&mdash;this
minute; she&#8217;s on this train! Poictiers, if you are
any friend of mine, you&#8217;ll climb down here and
find a club and put me out of my misery!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>Carfax stopped laughing suddenly and sprang
out of the car. &#8220;It&#8217;s no joke!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;It&#8217;s
up to us, you wild ass of the desert&mdash;do you hear?
Stop your braying and listen to me: we&#8217;ve got
to meet her over there on that platform just as
if we had been watching every train for a week!
There is the whistle: come along and invent your
fairy-tale on the run!&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not crowd too eagerly to the front
when the three-car train drew up to the platform.
There were terms to be agreed upon; things
which might be said, and things which must not
be said. Thus it happened that an exceedingly
handsome young woman, in a modish travelling
hat and a brown coat, and followed by a French
maid bearing impedimenta, was helped from the
car-step by the brakeman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge!&#8221; Carfax commanded, in a hoarse
whisper; but before they could do it, Miss
Richardia slipped through the ranks of the platform
loungers, put her arms quickly about the
handsome young woman and kissed her, with an
&#8220;Oh, you dear thing!&#8221; to go with the affectionate
welcome.</p>

<p>Tregarvon saw, gasped, swallowed hard, and
the smile of greeting which he had called up for
the emergency turned into a shocked grin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>&#8220;Get out in the road there and chunk me!&#8221;
he whispered to Carfax. And then: &#8220;Poictiers,
I&#8217;m a ruined man! They were together in the
Boston music factory. Elizabeth has told me a
hundred times how she chummed with a charming
little Southerner&mdash;without naming any names!
And I&#8217;ve been writing her&mdash;oh, I tell you, I&#8217;m a
dead man. All you have to do now is to get a
wreath to lay on my coffin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be needing the coffin if you don&#8217;t buck
up and catch the step!&#8221; hissed Carfax. Wherewith
he dragged his companion masterfully into
the circle of welcomings.</p>

<p>The golden youth neither gave nor received the
kiss of greeting; and he pointedly looked another
way when Miss Wardwell offered her cheek for
Tregarvon&#8217;s cousinly salute. Then he found himself
shaking hands with Richardia&#8217;s father; realized
vaguely that the judge was taxing him reproachfully
for not having consented to occupy
one of the many bed-rooms at Westwood House
the night before, instead of returning to Highmount;
realized also that Miss Wardwell was
rallying Tregarvon gayly upon his discomfiture
accomplished by means of the jesting telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, it didn&#8217;t mislead you, too, did it,
Poictiers?&#8221; she questioned, turning to Tregarvon&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
accomplice. &#8220;Vance is trying to tell me
that you took it harder than he did.&#8221; Then she
explained to Judge Birrell: &#8220;I sent a wire to
these two from Chattanooga, you know, asking
them if they could put me and Clotilde up at the
Coalville hotel&mdash;by the way, Cousin Vance, where
<i>is</i> the hotel?&#8221; Then again to the judge: &#8220;You
see, I guessed, from what Richardia said in her
last letter, that they didn&#8217;t know I was invited
to Westwood House. Fancy it! they got the
telegram only a few minutes ago!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon backed out of the group and fanned
himself with his hat. There were still traces of
the shocked grin to temper the mask of feverish
anxiety which was slowly displacing it. Everything
he had ever written to Elizabeth about Richardia&mdash;everything
he had ever told Richardia
about Elizabeth&mdash;clamored for instant recollection
and revision in the light of the unnerving
fact that the two of them were here on the Coalville
platform, together, as friends of long standing.</p>

<p>The train had moved on, the loungers were
dispersing, and Miss Birrell was leading the way
to the venerable surrey.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_328.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Poictiers, I&#8217;m a ruined man!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;Mr. Carfax has promised me that he will
drive you up to Westwood House to-morrow. I
think you will be very sure to come, now,&#8221; she
said, after Tregarvon had flogged himself into
some livelier sense of the requirements of the moment.
Then she added: &#8220;You may come as
early as you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall be very ill to-morrow,&#8221; he returned
gravely, as he handed her into the carriage.
&#8220;These sudden shocks are very bad&mdash;for the
heart.&#8221; Then, while Carfax was helping Miss
Wardwell to the front seat with the judge: &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t believe you could be so wicked!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not the wicked one,&#8221; was the quick retort.
&#8220;I tried to tell you last Wednesday; that was
why I asked Mr. Carfax to drive down to where
you were working. But you wouldn&#8217;t let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am not too ill to come, you must let me
see you first, before I&mdash;&#8221; Tregarvon was beginning;
but Miss Richardia was not willing to be
dragged even into the vicinity of things confidential.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear him!&#8221; she said to Miss Wardwell; &#8220;Mr.
Tregarvon is intimating that we have made him
ill, between us!&#8221; Then she spoke to her father:
&#8220;Judge Birrell, you will please command these
two young gentlemen to report to you to-morrow
at Westwood House&mdash;do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The judge gave the invitation in due and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
courteous form, and Carfax accepted promptly
for himself and for Tregarvon. After which the
big dapple gray, mildly urged by his master,
began to jog up and down and the age-worn surrey
crept out of sight around the barrier rank of coke-ovens.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might have offered to take them up in
the motor,&#8221; said Carfax, when the afterthought
had been given time to come to the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> might have,&#8221; Tregarvon returned moodily.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t trust myself to drive a wheel-barrow
in the present state of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was about to swing himself behind the
wheel to drive the car over to its shed and he
paused with a foot on the running-board.</p>

<p>&#8220;When it comes to wrestling with the fateful
tangles, you haven&#8217;t so much the best of me as
you may think you have&mdash;thanks to your little
gift of letter-writing,&#8221; he remarked darkly.</p>

<p>Tregarvon walked across to the office-building
while Carfax was housing the car, went to his
room, and was visible no more until Uncle William
called him to dinner. At table he ate like an
ogre&mdash;a sure sign of disturbment&mdash;and refused to
rise to any of the small conversational baits flung
out by Carfax. But afterward, over the tobacco-jar,
there were things to be said and he said them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>&#8220;Poictiers, I believe I&#8217;ll write my will to-night
and let you witness it,&#8221; he began. &#8220;The easiest
thing for me to do now is to go and offer myself
to the chief of the bureau of tests as a candidate
for the poison squad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning that Elizabeth is here to answer your
letter in person?&#8221; queried Carfax. &#8220;There is
nothing so very deadly about that, is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That remark shows how little you know
women. I was perfectly frank with Elizabeth, as
I told you, but of course I didn&#8217;t write as I should
have written if I had known that she and Richardia
were bosom friends. Now they will proceed
to exchange confidences and compare notes&mdash;if
they haven&#8217;t already done both in their letters
to each other. And what the comparison will
leave of me won&#8217;t be fit to fling to a starved
puppy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax smoked in silence for quite some time
before he said: &#8220;How they may stick pins into
you, to your face or behind your back, seems a
very inconsiderable factor in the case to me,
Vance. The deadly part of it is that you are still
in love&mdash;or you think you are&mdash;with Richardia
Birrell, while you are going to marry Elizabeth
Wardwell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Tregarvon objected, staring gloomily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
into the fire; &#8220;that isn&#8217;t the worst of it. There
is a still deeper depth: I can&#8217;t help being the one
or doing the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax began to show signs of becoming restive.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Elizabeth only didn&#8217;t care so much for
you....&#8221; Then he took a new tack. &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t tell her all you ought to have told her in
that letter, Vance; if you had, you wouldn&#8217;t be
dreading the actual show-down as you are now.
Which means that you still have it to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is it, exactly,&#8221; said the dejected one.
&#8220;And I&#8217;d much rather be shot full of holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax took another dose of his own prescription
of silence. Then he said: &#8220;What is going to
come of it?&mdash;after you have made her understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing that can come of it. While I
have insisted, and still insist, that there has never
been any sentiment wasted between us, the fact
remains that Elizabeth is a woman, and she isn&#8217;t
going to sit down meekly and say, &#8216;All right,
Vance, dear; never mind,&#8217; when I make her understand
that I have been trying my hardest to
make love to another woman. She has plenty of
spirit; she can fairly set you afire with those
brown eyes of hers when the occasion demands
it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Carfax.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be all over but the shouting, then.
She will doubtless tell me what she thinks of me
and break the engagement, there and then&mdash;or
try to. But that is the one thing I can&#8217;t let her
do, Poictiers. She needs the Uncle Byrd legacy,
and I mustn&#8217;t let her lose it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax got up and reached for the matches and
his bed-room candle. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said slowly; &#8220;you
mustn&#8217;t let her lose the legacy. To a man up a
tree it would seem that the money is about all
she is going to salvage out of the wreck.&#8221; With
which unkind daggering of the sinner whose sin
had found him out, he went to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII<br />


<small>At Westwood House</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE autumn Sunday afternoon figured as
the flawless half of a day of perfection,
with the sky a vivid blue and the hardwood forest
of the mountain top, lately touched by the first
sharp frosts, a riot of gorgeous coloring. On the
broad veranda of the ancient manor-house of
Westwood the conversation, which had been desultory
at best, languished in sympathy with the
reposeful spell of time and place and the peaceful
surroundings.</p>

<p>With a gently worded phrase of apology to his
daughter&#8217;s guest, the judge had pleaded an old
man&#8217;s privilege, dragging his chair to the farther
end of the veranda and lighting his corn-cob pipe
in courteous isolation. Tregarvon marked the
bit of old-fashioned chivalric deference to Elizabeth,
and wondered how many men of his own
generation would be as thoughtfully considerate
of the small amenities.</p>

<p>The thought was one of a series emphasizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
the gross incredibility of the theory involving
Richardia&#8217;s father in the conspiracy against the
Ocoee. That the white-haired, ruddy-faced Chesterfield
of Westwood House might challenge an
antagonist, give him the choice of weapons, and
afterward kill him unflinchingly, was easily conceivable.
But that he would descend to the
methods of the dynamiter or the midnight assassin
was momently growing more and more unbelievable.</p>

<p>With Elizabeth for his <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> in her broad-armed
veranda chair, Tregarvon was finding it
increasingly difficult to fix his attention upon the
Ocoeean mysteries. For some reasons&mdash;the unfamiliar
surroundings, the gap of absence so
suddenly and unexpectedly bridged, or because
there was some subtle change in her&mdash;his cousin
was singularly reticent. While the talk remained
general she took her part in it; but whenever it
threatened to become a dialogue, Tregarvon was
instantly made to feel the raising of the barrier.</p>

<p>Since the guilty flee when no man pursueth,
Tregarvon fancied he need be at no loss to account
for Miss Wardwell&#8217;s attitude. She had
doubtless received his confession letter&mdash;though
no mention had been made of it&mdash;and beyond
that, she and Richardia had in all probability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
been comparing notes. He could feel the presence
of the Damoclean sword suspended above
his head, and was looking forward unjoyously to
the moment when chance, or design on the part
of Carfax and Richardia, would give Miss Wardwell
her reproachful opportunity.</p>

<p>The dreaded moment came when Miss Richardia,
who had been discussing autumn flowers
with Carfax, asked the golden youth if he would
like to see her chrysanthemums and asters in the
sheltered posy-patch in the rear of the manor-house.
And when they were gone, Tregarvon
was left alone with his responsibilities.</p>

<p>It was Miss Wardwell who first broke the little
silence which followed the departure of the
flower seekers, and her manner was distinctly at
variance with her accustomed attitude of serenity
and self-possession; was rather the manner of
one marching reluctantly but firmly up to the
mouth of a loaded cannon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you tremendously shocked yesterday
afternoon when you learned that I was coming?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no use to deny it,&#8221; he confessed bravely.
&#8220;It was a complete surprise&mdash;as you probably
intended it to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I didn&#8217;t intend it&mdash;until just at the last.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
Richardia has been asking me to come down, and
she knew a week or more ago that I was coming.
I supposed, of course, she would tell you, and
didn&#8217;t know that she hadn&#8217;t told you until I received
her last letter, just as we were leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came with your father and mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Pennsylvania has been building some
monuments on the old battle-fields, and papa is
one of the commissioners. He and mamma
didn&#8217;t particularly wish to be bothered with me,
I imagine, but I had to come. Have you guessed
why, Vance?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon thought he knew the constraining
reason very well, indeed, but he was not quite
courageous enough to say so. Instead, he temporized,
as a man will, postponing the instant
when the hair-hung sword must fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the poorest of mind-readers,&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t even read my own, at times.
But I suppose you have my letter, and you thought
it ought to be answered in person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had many letters from you: which
one do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one I wrote a week ago to-day in the
hotel in Chattanooga.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly. &#8220;No; your last
letter was written two weeks ago, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
postmarked &#8216;Coalville.&#8217; I remember you said
you were writing after Poictiers had gone to
bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon groaned inwardly. The thing which
he thought had been safely done had not been
done at all; it still remained to be done. He was
bracing himself to take the plunge when she
went on hurriedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were saying just now that you couldn&#8217;t
read your own mind&mdash;sometimes. I wish I might
read it now&mdash;this moment, Cousin Vance!&#8221; She
was trying to look him fairly in the eyes and was
not succeeding very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read my mind?&mdash;heaven forbid!&#8221; he gasped.
Then he came to his senses and tried to repair
the terrible misstep. &#8220;You know&mdash;er&mdash;you know
what I mean; a man&#8217;s mind is seldom fit for a&mdash;a
good woman to look into, Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours is, always,&#8221; she asserted loyally, and
he winced as if she had struck him a blow. &#8220;I
assure you I haven&#8217;t known you all my life for
nothing, Vance. And it was because I had
known you as no other woman ever will, that I
was willing to try to make you happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was wondering dumbly how much of this
he could stand when she continued, quite calmly,
though the brown eyes were looking past him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>&#8220;As I have said, I had to come: there is a
crisis; and with your letters before me, I couldn&#8217;t
write. We agreed once, you remember, to go
around the sentimental field instead of going
through it; but&mdash;but you haven&#8217;t been living up
to the spirit of that agreement in your letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon found his handkerchief and mopped
his face. The matchless autumn afternoon had
grown suddenly sweltering for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that I&#8217;ve been writing you love-letters?
I&#8217;m a brute, Elizabeth. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t make it any harder for me than
you are obliged to,&#8221; she pleaded gently. &#8220;If
you stop me now, I shall never be able to go on.
I have come all the way down here to say something
to you; something that I couldn&#8217;t write,
and a thing that every added letter of yours was
making more difficult to say. But one word from
you now will make it easier&mdash;if it is the right
word. Tell me, Vance; hasn&#8217;t this separation
proved to you that we couldn&#8217;t&mdash;that cousins
ought not to marry?&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly it ground its way into his brain that
the worst had befallen; that Elizabeth, really
and truly in love with him, now, had guessed,
either from his letters or from Richardia&#8217;s, the
true state of affairs; and that womanly pride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
and affection had brought her to the scene of
action to commit martyrdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by Jove!&mdash;you mustn&#8217;t, Elizabeth!&#8221; he
broke out in a sudden access of contrition. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t allow you to outdo me in pure generosity
that way! And, besides, there is Uncle Byrd&#8217;s
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of that, too,&#8221; she said, quite
judicially. &#8220;But, Vance, dear, we must simply
rise superior to all the mere money considerations.
Richardia has been telling me about your prospects
here&mdash;your mine&mdash;and your brave struggle
to make something out of nothing. You will need
Uncle Byrd&#8217;s money; you are needing it now.
And I&mdash;if we&mdash;well, I shall not need it, anyhow,&#8221;
she ended rather incoherently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord help me, Elizabeth!&#8221; he groaned,
entirely ignoring the white-haired, white-mustached
figure smoking peacefully at the farther
end of the veranda. &#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she agreed instantly; &#8220;you
deserve ... well, you deserve something quite
different. But whatever happens, and whatever
you say, I must do what I came here to do. I&mdash;I
have made a discovery, Cousin Vance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you have,&#8221; he said desperately. &#8220;I
knew you would, sooner or later, though I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
tried awfully hard to make myself believe that
there wasn&#8217;t any discovery to be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know: but seriously, Vance; deep down in
your heart, you don&#8217;t really care, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Elizabeth! Of course I care. And I
have blamed myself straight through from the
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you mustn&#8217;t do that!&#8221; she protested
quickly. &#8220;It is all my fault, or my&mdash;no, I simply
<i>won&#8217;t</i> call it a misfortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fault?&#8221; he queried. &#8220;You mean because
you didn&#8217;t suspect it and choke it off right
at the beginning. But I haven&#8217;t give you a chance
to do that, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suspect it,&#8221; she said musingly; &#8220;I
was very far from suspecting it. It came all at
once, like a blow, you know; and then it was too
late to &#8216;choke it off,&#8217; as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man, the true man, in him rose up in its
might to buffet him into the path of uprightness
and straightforwardness. &#8220;No; it is not too late,
Elizabeth,&#8221; he assured her gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; she objected with pathetic earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;We must still make good.
Do you know what people at home will say if
our engagement is broken now? They will say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
that I made it impossible for you to carry out
Uncle Byrd&#8217;s wishes; and that I did it deliberately,
to get the money for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried in wide-eyed
astonishment. &#8220;<i>I</i> am the guilty one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. This is what I came all the way from
Philadelphia to say to you, Vance. Do you remember,
one time when we were trying to &#8216;galvanize,&#8217;
I think that was the word you used, ourselves
into the sentimental ecstasy supposed to be
the normal condition of engaged people, I told you
jokingly that if I ever found any one whom I
could really lo&mdash;like better&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Elizabeth!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, soberly and looked away from him.
&#8220;Yes; it is true; and I had to come and tell you.
You may despise me; it is your privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon got up and took the necessary step
to the veranda end which gave him the view
into the rearward flower-garden. They were
there, Carfax and Richardia, bending together
over the chrysanthemums. When he turned back
to face his cousin he was smiling grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As our cattle-ranching cousin in the West
would say, you mustn&#8217;t &#8216;rawhide&#8217; yourself too
severely, Elizabeth. Leaving the dollars out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
it&mdash;and I&#8217;ll find a way to leave them out if I have
to throw them to the birds&mdash;I&#8217;m getting about
what I deserve; which is the glad hand all around
the block.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are bitter, and I can&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; she
said, with something alarmingly like a sob at the
catching of her breath. &#8220;But really, at the very
bottom of it all, you don&#8217;t care so very much, do
you, Vance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I? I&#8217;d be a mighty good specimen of
the superman if I didn&#8217;t care. Who is this fellow
who, coming after me, is preferred before
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;oh, you are perfectly savage with
me!&mdash;because he has had no right to speak, nor
I to listen. He hasn&#8217;t spoken; he may never
speak. But that doesn&#8217;t make any difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tregarvon wearily; &#8220;nothing makes
any difference now. But I told you a moment
ago not to reproach yourself too bitterly. I am
in precisely the same sort of a boat myself,
Elizabeth&mdash;without your good hope of getting
ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You? <i>Vance!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim smile came again, and he said&mdash;though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
rather in shame than in malice: &#8220;It hurts a little,
doesn&#8217;t it?&mdash;when it is the other way about.
For nearly a week I have been thinking that you
knew. I told you all about it, you know, in the
letter I wrote last Sunday night in Chattanooga;
the letter which seems to have gone astray.
That is why I was so slow in getting your meaning:
I was looking for you to dagger me the other
way around, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Wardwell was no longer embarrassed, but
she was well-nigh tearful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is one of those horridly pretty
Southern girls in the school,&#8221; she said half-spitefully.
&#8220;Have you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he hastened to say; &#8220;I have been almost
as decent as the other fellow; the fellow you
won&#8217;t name for me. I haven&#8217;t asked her to marry
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going to marry a man old enough to
be her father&mdash;if she doesn&#8217;t reconsider and
marry a young donkey of a millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rucker, following an order which had been
given him earlier in the day, was tooling the
yellow car up the weed-grown carriage approach,
coming to drive the two young men back to
Coalville. Also, Carfax and Miss Birrell were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
returning from the posy-patch. Miss Wardwell
stood up and put her hands into Tregarvon&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry and happy and miserable all in the
same breath,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I shall be here for a
few days. Papa and mamma are going over to
the Shiloh battle-field after they leave Chattanooga,
and I shall stay until they come back.
You&#8217;ll come again, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was able to smile down into the brown
eyes of beseeching. The stabbed-vanity pain was
passing&mdash;a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly I shall come, as often as you
can get me an invitation, and as my job on the
Ocoee will permit. I don&#8217;t propose to lose my
best cousin just because I happen to have lost a
lot of other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the key-note of the cheerful tone which
he contrived to preserve throughout the leave-takings.
But at the car boarding he let Carfax
have the tonneau to himself, taking the seat beside
Rucker for the better chance it offered for a
needed interval in which to bind up the wounds
of the pierced <i>amour-propre</i>.</p>

<small>The Unknown Quantity</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the yellow motor-car, driven by
Rucker with his customary disregard for
speed limitations, had crossed the mountain and
was approaching Highmount and the forking of
the wood road leading to the old negro burying-ground,
Tregarvon told the mechanician to stop
and let him out. To Carfax he made plausible
excuse: Tryon was watching at the drilling plant
and he might have something to report. It was
still only mid-afternoon, and Tregarvon added
that he would walk to Coalville by way of the
tramhead and the short-cut path.</p>

<p>After the car had gone on, Tregarvon kept the
first part of his promise, covering the half-mile
briskly. Tryon was at his post, killing time with
the aid of strong tobacco and a railroad man&#8217;s
clay pipe. He had relieved Rucker at noon, in
accordance with his orders; there had been no
Sunday-afternoon visitors&mdash;nothing to disturb the
peace of the day of rest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>Tregarvon listened perfunctorily to the foreman&#8217;s
report. His object in delaying his return
to Coalville had been only half formed at the
moment of car stopping, but it had nothing to do
with checking up the day-watchman. The talk
with Elizabeth and its astounding revelations
had opened new vistas. With Elizabeth calmly
proposing to marry some one else, if the some one
else should ask her, a full half of the spur which
had been driving him to fight the Ocoee battle
to a finish was gone.</p>

<p>Under the changed conditions the sensible thing
to do, after all, might be to close with the coal
trust&#8217;s offer. But before committing himself
finally to this, he was inclined to go to Hartridge
with a frank plea for a word of friendly advice.
From what had transpired it was evident that the
professor of mathematics knew much more about
the Ocoee and its mysteries than he had as yet
been willing to tell; and though the episode of the
steel cubes seemed to array him definitely on the
side of the enemy, his later warning in the matter
of bargain and sale was unquestionably disinterested,
if not actively amicable.</p>

<p>Tregarvon was still considering the half-formed
resolve to appeal to Hartridge when Tryon fished
in the pocket of his overalls and brought up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
three small cubes of metal, the exact counterparts
of the one which Carfax had taken from the
pocket of the schoolmaster&#8217;s overcoat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I been savin&#8217; these to show you,&#8221; said the
foreman, handing the bits of metal to Tregarvon.
&#8220;What-all d&#8217;you reckon they&#8217;re meant for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon permitted the query to go unanswered.
&#8220;Where did you find them?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the pocket of an old coat that Jim Sawyer&#8217;s
been wearin&#8217; here on the job. It&#8217;s hangin&#8217; up in
the tool shanty. I run out o&#8217; matches a little
spell ago, and went to rummagin&#8217; &#8217;round to see if
I couldn&#8217;t find some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sawyer&#8217;s coat, eh?&#8221; said Tregarvon, struck
suddenly alert.</p>

<p>Tryon nodded soberly. &#8220;An&#8217; that ain&#8217;t all,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;I got a file and tried &#8217;em; they&#8217;re
harder &#8217;n flint&mdash;been tempered till you couldn&#8217;t
cut &#8217;em with anything softer &#8217;n an emery-wheel.
Rucker&#8217;d been tellin&#8217; me how the drills went all
to the bad that time when you was hung up
before the old b&#8217;iler bu&#8217;sted. Sawyer&#8217;s got a tool-box
in the shanty where he keeps his wrenches
and little traps. It was locked, but I happened
to have a key that fitted. What d&#8217;you reckon
I found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More of these?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it plumb centre; a tomatter can
about half full of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all you know about Sawyer,&#8221; Tregarvon
cut in concisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I know about him wouldn&#8217;t get him a
job anywheres where I had the say-so. Last
summer he was workin&#8217; for the C. C. &amp; I. at
Whitlow&mdash;a strike-breaker. Before that he was
doin&#8217; time at Brushy Mountain, for some sort o&#8217;
crookedness, I dunno what. Maybe I ort to &#8217;a&#8217;
told you this when you hired him, but I allowed
you knowed what you was doin&#8217;, an&#8217; it wasn&#8217;t
none o&#8217; my business. He&#8217;s a good drill boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was examining the bits of steel
critically. &#8220;Tryon, I&#8217;d give something to know
just where these came from originally,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I might help out a little on that, too.
I served my time in the shop before I went to
work for the railroad. D&#8217;you know what kind o&#8217;
steel that is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some o&#8217; that new-fangled, high-speed tool-steel
that you temper by heatin&#8217; it white-hot and
coolin&#8217; it in a fan blast. Jenkins, the Whitlow
blacksmith, was showin&#8217; me a piece of it last
Sat&#8217;day night at Tait&#8217;s. Looked like it might &#8217;a&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
been cut off the same bar with these little chunks
o&#8217; Jim Sawyer&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, you believe that these bits
were made in the Whitlow blacksmith shop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-sayin&#8217; so, because I can&#8217;t prove it.
But my boy, Tom, saw Thaxter, the Whitlow
bookkeeper, stop his buggy in the big road two
or three days ago whilst a man came out o&#8217; the
bushes to talk to him. The man was Jim Sawyer.
More &#8217;n that, there&#8217;s just natchelly only the one
place in the Wehatchee where that steel <i>could</i>
come from. They&#8217;ve got it at Whitlow, an&#8217; I
don&#8217;t reckon there&#8217;s ar&#8217; another blacksmith shop
in the valley that ever heerd tell of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tryon, you&#8217;ve done a good afternoon&#8217;s work,&#8221;
said the master of Ocoee, dropping the three cubes
into his pocket. &#8220;We owe all of our hard luck,
excepting the blown-up boiler, which may have
been due to its own rottenness, to the C. C. &amp; I.,
with Thaxter pulling the strings and Sawyer
doing the actual dirty work. Isn&#8217;t that the way
you have it figured out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the way it <i>ort</i> to stack up,&#8221;
said the foreman. &#8220;But somehow it don&#8217;t gee
all the way &#8217;round. You&#8217;d say it&#8217;s mighty near
a dead cinch that Sawyer was the one that doped
the drill-hole with these here slow-&#8217;em-downs;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
but right there the vein pinches out. Them two
times that the walkin&#8217;-beam fell down, Sawyer
was the man that stood the best chance o&#8217; gettin&#8217;
his head bu&#8217;sted. Then you an&#8217; Mr. Carfax both
saw the man that put the dannymite into the
old b&#8217;iler, an&#8217; I hain&#8217;t heerd neither one of you
a-sayin&#8217; it was Sawyer. You&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; knowed him,
wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t Sawyer,&#8221; said Tregarvon definitively.
&#8220;Sawyer has a beard, and that man was
smooth-faced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jes&#8217; so,&#8221; nodded the foreman. Then he drew
his own conclusion. &#8220;I been knowin&#8217; the C. C.
&amp; I. crowd, off an&#8217; on, ever sence they took holt
here in the Wehatchee. I reckon they&#8217;d rough-house
you in a holy minute if they thought that
was the easiest way to get the best o&#8217; you in some
business fight. I wouldn&#8217;t even put the dannymitin&#8217;
a-past &#8217;em. But they wouldn&#8217;t go at it in
no such a bunglesome way; n&#8217;r they wouldn&#8217;t put
skulls in your fire-box, n&#8217;r any such fool monkeyshines
as that. Them things don&#8217;t fit in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Tregarvon bestowed the meed of praise
where praise was due.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tryon, you have a pretty level head. I am
beginning to suspect that we made a mistake in
not calling you in as chief detective in this muddle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
But you still think that Thaxter and Sawyer
worked the drill-dulling scheme, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ez I say, that part of it proves up toler&#8217;ble
plain. If there was ar&#8217; reason, now, why they&#8217;d
want to be holdin&#8217; you back for a little spell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a reason. They are trying to buy
me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talkin&#8217;!&#8221; said the foreman sagely.
&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve got coal here under your feet, &#8217;r
maybe you hain&#8217;t. <i>You</i> don&#8217;t know, yet, an&#8217;
maybe <i>they</i> don&#8217;t know. But they&#8217;d just as soon
you wouldn&#8217;t find out for sure whilst the dickerin&#8217;
&#8217;s goin&#8217; on. They&#8217;d like as not call it &#8216;good
business&#8217; to hold you up for a spell, wouldn&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite likely,&#8221; Tregarvon was glancing at his
watch. The call upon Hartridge had now become
a necessity, if only for apologetic and explanatory
reasons. True, it was still possible that the
professor had been in collusion with the planter
of steel cubes on the night of surprises, but these
later developments seemed to exonerate him
handsomely. &#8220;I must go,&#8221; he told the foreman.
&#8220;Rucker will relieve you here in time for you to
go to your supper. If Sawyer should happen to
turn up, just keep your own counsel about what
we have discovered. We&#8217;ll deal with him&mdash;and
his bosses&mdash;when the time comes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>A few minutes beyond this, Tregarvon was
at Highmount, inquiring for Professor Hartridge.
The young woman who answered his ring told him
that the professor had gone over to the McNabb
neighborhood to see a sick child. Not wishing to
let his opportunity escape, Tregarvon set out to
walk through the forest, taking a path leading in
the general direction of the sunken mountain-top
valley known locally as the &#8220;Pocket&#8221;; this on
the chance of meeting Hartridge and walking
back to the school with him.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that Tregarvon had never
visited the &#8220;Pocket,&#8221; and though he knew, from
Carfax&#8217;s description of the locality, that it could
not be more than a mile or two beyond Highmount,
he was not aware that the path he had
chosen was not the right one. Having plenty of
other things to think about, he paid little attention
to his surroundings until, at the end of a half-hour,
he found that the path, which had been
growing indistinct, had disappeared entirely,
leaving him in a region of deep ravines with their
slopes heavily wooded; hollows boulder-strewn, in
which the old-growth timber stood thickly, with
only a fallen and rotting trunk here and there
to show where the tan-bark gatherers had slain
some monarch of the forest for the paltry stripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
of its outer skin&mdash;mute testimony to the waste of
a nation.</p>

<p>It was not until after he had covered distance
enough, as he thought, to have taken him all the
way across from Highmount to the western brow
of the mountain, that he saw a man&mdash;whom he
took to be Hartridge&mdash;sitting upon a flat stone
in the shadow of a great boulder on the opposite
side of a small mountain brook. Just as he was
about to call out and make his presence known,
the man sprang to his feet suddenly, as if in alarm,
and whipped a weapon from his pocket.</p>

<p>Obeying the instinct of self-preservation in
pure automatism, Tregarvon dropped silently behind
the nearest boulder on his own side of the
stream. When he looked again he saw that the
man was not Hartridge; he was a much younger
man; a handsome young fellow, well-built and
athletic-looking, with nothing in his appearance
to connect him with the mountain and its natives.
The attitude of strained anxiety into which the
quick leap afoot had thrown him lasted only for
a moment. While Tregarvon looked, a warbling
bird whistle rose shrill and clear on the windless
air. The watcher saw the young man hastily
pocket the pistol and heard him whistle a reply.
Almost at the same instant the figure of a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
appeared at the buried up-hill heel of the great
boulder. She stood for a moment in the yellow
light of the westering sun, long enough for Tregarvon
to recognize her beyond any question of
doubt. Then she ran, slipping and sliding, down
the leaf-carpeted hazard slope, to be caught in
the arms of the waiting man.</p>

<p>For a little time Tregarvon sat with his back to
the sheltering boulder, trying to surround this
latest and newest development in the maze of
mysteries. Slowly it came to him that this was
the explanation of Richardia&#8217;s attitude; the
reason why she had slipped aside, masking the
true state of affairs and rebuffing him by seeming
to accept the attentions of Carfax. One by one
the corroborative inferences fell into place, each
fitting with exact nicety: Richardia&#8217;s piquant
reticences; her half-confidences which had always
stopped short of revealment; her little flights to
the shelter of detachment whenever the talk
threatened to lean toward sentiment; all these
were signs which might have been read&mdash;which
were plainly readable now in the light of the small
tableau staging itself in the shadow of the great
rock on the opposite hillside.</p>

<p>Tregarvon peeped again. It was most obviously
a lovers&#8217; meeting. The young man had drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
the judge&#8217;s daughter to a seat beside him on the
flat stone, and he still had his arm about her.
They were talking eagerly in low tones; Tregarvon
could hear only a murmur of voices, but
Richardia&#8217;s face was toward him, and in it he re-read
his complete effacement. In a series of revealing
flashes more of the corroborative fragments
whisked into place; he had been blind not
to see the pointing of certain playful allusions
made now and then at the Caswells&#8217; dinner-table
and aimed at the music teacher. Doubtless, to
the small world of the mountain top, these Sunday-afternoon
trysts in the forest were an old
story. But why were they clandestine? The
answer fitted itself promptly. By all accounts
Judge Birrell was a person of shrewd prejudices;
quite possibly he disapproved of this young man
who had stolen his daughter&#8217;s heart; and perhaps
the disapproval was not entirely without reason.
Tregarvon recalled the signs of perturbation and
the sudden pistol drawing which had preceded
Richardia&#8217;s appearance.</p>

<p>In deference to a prompting which took its
color more from complete and hopeless chagrin
than from any charitable scruples, Tregarvon
squared his back against the concealing boulder
and refused to look any more. While the pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
across the streamlet kept their places, it was impossible
for him to retreat undiscovered. The
waiting interval was not unduly long. When he
could no longer distinguish the murmur of voices
he ventured to peep again. The flat-stone seat
was empty and they were gone.</p>

<p>The sun had dropped behind the mountain, and
Tregarvon was tramping soberly through the
lengthening wood shadows toward Highmount,
when the frock-coated figure of the professor of
mathematics loomed suddenly in the path ahead.
At Tregarvon&#8217;s call, Hartridge stopped and waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a pleasant surprise,&#8221; said the schoolmaster,
with his genial smile. &#8220;Are you walking
my way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very pointedly,&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;They told
me at the college that you had gone to one of the
McNabbs&#8217;, and I came out on the chance of
meeting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was neighborly, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; returned the
master of arts, catching the step. &#8220;Am I to
infer that you are going to let me be of some
service to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s laugh was a trifle strained. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a little that way,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;But first I
wish to say that I believe we have been doing you
an injustice&mdash;Carfax and I.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;About the small cube of the metal known
commercially as steel?&#8221; was the gentle inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. I&#8217;m sorry we were not broad-minded
enough to take your word in explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have discovered the real culprit?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer Tregarvon briefed the story of
Tryon&#8217;s findings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the listener; &#8220;then my own impression
wasn&#8217;t at fault, after all. I saw the man
under the drill derrick: I thought it was Sawyer,
but I couldn&#8217;t be certain. I assume you don&#8217;t
need to be told why he did it, or who bribed him
to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. For some reason best known to themselves,
the C. C. &amp; I. people do not wish me to
drill that test-hole in the old burying-ground.
Do you know the reason, Professor Hartridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was too nearly dark for Tregarvon to see the
quizzical smile which this query evoked, but he
knew it was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are asking me as man to man, Mr.
Tregarvon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;just that. I have been condemning you
unjustly, and you now have a most excellent
chance to heap coals of fire upon my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are making it impossible for me to hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
malice,&#8221; was the genial response. &#8220;I wish I could
answer your question definitely; but I cannot.
I do <i>not</i> know why Thaxter should wish to prevent
you from drilling that particular test-hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that I am not going to find the
paying vein of coal under the old burying-ground?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am practically certain that you are not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind giving me your reasons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are geological&mdash;and conclusive. The
strata under the glade are precisely the same as
those occurring at your tramhead. Moreover, if
you will take the trouble to examine the ground
at the foot of the cliff below your present location
you will find the coal outcrop: a single vein, not
over twenty inches thick. A little lower down
you will find another, still thinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon laughed mirthlessly. &#8220;I asked you
for bread, and you have given me a stone,&#8221; he
protested. &#8220;Am I to assume that Consolidated
Coal is better informed than you are, professor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge&#8217;s reply was guarded. &#8220;No man is
infallible, Mr. Tregarvon. I speak only of the
things I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is a chance that, in spite of your
geological deduction, Thaxter and the men he
represents have more accurate data?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the professor&#8217;s rejoinder was fairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
cryptic. &#8220;The earth holds many secrets. During
the long interval in which the Ocoee properties
were allowed to lie idle and uncared for, it was
anybody&#8217;s privilege to investigate them. I am
violating no confidence in saying that the people
who are now trying to induce you to sell have
made a number of surveys. They probably know
your ground foot by foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Tregarvon found himself confronted
by the dead wall of Hartridge&#8217;s reservations.
That the professor was making reservations he
did not doubt for an instant. There was still
some bar to perfect frankness, and he seemed
powerless to break it down. In sheer desperation
he shunted the talk to the field of the obstacles.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be conclusively proved that the
drill-dulling is chargeable to Thaxter, acting
through the man Sawyer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But Tryon
refuses to believe that the other harassings have
been inspired by the trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the Highmount boundary,
and Hartridge paused with his hand on the gate
latch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am entirely at one with your foreman in
that belief, Mr. Tregarvon,&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;Now
that we are again upon amicable terms, I may
confess that I have been greatly interested in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
problem which these harassments have presented&mdash;the
solving of problems being one of my small
recreations. Did you leave an enemy at home
who would be vindictive enough to follow you
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon shook his head. &#8220;So far as I know,
I hadn&#8217;t an enemy in the wide world when I
came here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have developed one <i>in situ</i>, as it
were, and a very unscrupulous one. Have you
formed any theory of your own?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None that is worth considering. At first, I
suspected the McNabbs, fancying that their
enmity might be a holdover on account of the
old lawsuit about the land titles. That was before
I knew that I had two of them working for
me in the drill-gang. Later&mdash;I am ashamed to
confess it&mdash;I thought that possibly Judge Birrell
might have passed the word that I was to be
driven out. That was a pure absurdity, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;The judge is
entirely incapable of doing such a thing, bitter as
some of his prejudices are. It need not be denied
that he was prejudiced against you at first. One
evening, when he was driving with his daughter,
he visited your drilling plant and was greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
incensed at finding it in the old Westwood slave
burying-ground. But now you and Mr. Carfax
have met him and have eaten at his table, and
this, to a man of his characteristics, salves all
wounds. Besides, as a matter of fact, you owe
the help which enabled you to place your new
power-plant directly to the judge. It was he who
sent word to the mountain-folk to turn out with
their teams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surprise me!&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;How
did he know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge smiled amiably. &#8220;You are not
wholly in Mr. Carfax&#8217;s confidence, it would seem.
On the evening when you had the trouble with
the valley farmers, he and Miss Richardia drove
over to Westwood House in your car while we
waited dinner for them here at the school. And
the next morning, presto! you had your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are guessing at this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not wholly. I have just been to the &#8216;Pocket&#8217;
to see Sill McNabb&#8217;s little daughter, who is sick&mdash;doctoring
people being another of my small
recreations. When I pressed him, Sill told me
that the order to help you came from Judge
Birrell, and that it was put upon the score of
common neighborliness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the idea of helping me originated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
the judge&#8217;s daughter,&#8221; Tregarvon put in soberly.
&#8220;Why should she wish to return good for evil,
Professor Hartridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Hartridge&#8217;s smile was less amiable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Richardia&#8217;s motives are not to be questioned
by either of us, Mr. Tregarvon. But why
should you call her interest in your affair returning
good for evil?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon fought away from the edge of the
pit into which his incorrigible ingenuousness was
about to precipitate him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there isn&#8217;t any reason why she should
consider me. Within the past hour I have had
the best possible proof of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge was silent for a moment. Then he
said: &#8220;Mr. Tregarvon, I trust you are a gentleman
in all that the much-misused word implies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man may hardly assert that of himself,&#8221; was
the quick retort. &#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you have just said implies a knowledge
of a secret which has been most carefully guarded
by Miss Richardia&#8217;s friends. I am not in her
confidence, but I shall take it upon myself to
say that whatever she does is right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the man?&#8221; Tregarvon asked bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a question which Miss Richardia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
herself will doubtless answer at the proper time.
Until she chooses to answer it, neither you nor I
have any right to ask it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was turning away to continue his
walk to Coalville. But at the leave-taking instant
he faced about for a final word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it ever occurred to you, Professor Hartridge,
that this is a hell of a world?&#8221; he asked
gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has&mdash;many times. Won&#8217;t you stop and
take pot-luck with us at the faculty table? No?
Then I wish you a pleasant walk to the valley.
Good night.&#8221;</p>

<small>The Mangling of Poictiers</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">UPON leaving Highmount, Tregarvon took
the short-cut path down the mountain, and
was only a few minutes late for the dinner for two
served by Uncle William in the office dining-room
at Coalville. Though he had plenty of thought
material of his own to work upon, he could hardly
help observing that Carfax ate abstractedly and
was unusually silent. While the old negro was
coming and going, the talk, what little there was
of it, touched lightly upon the visit to Westwood
House; but after the table was cleared Carfax
got up to stand with his back to the open fire and
the commonplaces were thrust aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;When is it to be?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Tregarvon, who was still dallying with the
black coffee, looked up with a crooked smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;When is what to be?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean. We gave you your
chance with Elizabeth&mdash;Miss Richardia and I.
I hope you&#8217;re not going to tell me that you
flunked it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>The wry smile broke into a short laugh. &#8220;Oh,
no; I didn&#8217;t flunk it. But it&#8217;s all over, Poictiers.
I&#8217;m down and out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was trying to light a cigarette, but the
match went black and he did not seem to realize
that he had no fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;So your crime has found you out, has it?&#8221; he
said, and the gentle tone seemed to accentuate
rather than to soften the accusing assumption.</p>

<p>Tregarvon shook his head. &#8220;It was the other
way about. Elizabeth came down here for the express
purpose of asking my permission to fall in
love with some other fellow&mdash;no names named.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Wh-what!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is even so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and you believed her? You didn&#8217;t have
sense enough in that thick head of yours to know
that she was merely trying to save your face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; you&#8217;re off on the wrong foot altogether.
She didn&#8217;t get that letter I wrote her from
Chattanooga, and she hadn&#8217;t given me a chance
to tell her about Richardia. It was perfectly
straight. She has simply found the other man&mdash;the
right man&mdash;and she is honest enough to say
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that you didn&#8217;t tell her
anything about your crookedness down here?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes; we talked about that later on,
though, again, there were no names named. She
jumped to the conclusion that my &#8216;crookedness&#8217;,
as you call it, was with one of the pretty undergraduates
at Highmount, and I let it go at that.
There was no use of making a bad matter worse
by dragging Richardia&#8217;s name into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax took a pacing turn up and down the
room, broke it to go and stand for a full minute
staring out of a window at Uncle William&#8217;s cook-house,
and then faced about to say, almost pleadingly:
&#8220;You are <i>sure</i> she meant it, Vance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she meant it. She wouldn&#8217;t tell
me much about the other fellow, except to say
that it was some one whom I knew, and who was
too decent to try to break in while our engagement
still held good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she&mdash;she really would give the&mdash;the
other fellow a chance, if&mdash;if he had the nerve to
ask for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be something better than &#8216;a chance&#8217;,
I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Carfax took a pacing turn, coming back
from it to drop into the chair opposite Tregarvon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vance, <i>I</i> am the &#8216;other fellow,&#8217;&#8221; he said
softly. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t suspect it, did you? It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
began last summer when we were at Lake Placid
together. I thought it was all on my side of the
house; I didn&#8217;t dream that she wasn&#8217;t in love
with you in the&mdash;in the way she ought to have
been. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The interruption was the entrance of a softly
padding Uncle William, bearing a neatly tied
packet of letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey&#8217;s for dat lily-white missy fr&#8217;m de Norf
what&#8217;s staying with Miss Dick up at de ol&#8217; place,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;Mistoo Tait, he brung &#8217;em over,
an&#8217; ast would you-all gemmen please to send &#8217;em
up when you had de chanst.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon had found the wry smile again by
the time the old negro had shuffled away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I ought to congratulate you,
Poictiers, but I can&#8217;t just now; I&#8217;m too new a
widower. You&#8217;ll have to hug your happiness
alone for the present. You&#8217;ll excuse me, won&#8217;t
you? But, see here&mdash;how about this little side-play
with Richardia? You&#8217;re not going to be
allowed to play fast and loose with her&mdash;not while
I&#8217;m here to prevent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was absently fingering the packet of
letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Vance,&#8221; he broke in, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been
saying, all along, that this last attack of yours&mdash;with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
Richardia&mdash;was the real thing; that there
was no sentiment between you and Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; said the attacked one,
in a fresh thrill of self-pityings; &#8220;but I&#8217;m like
the little kiddie who dropped his candy to reach
for another piece and lost both. Just the same,
it seems that you are due to get yours, too;
you&#8217;ve proposed to one woman when you were in
love with another. What did Richardia say to
you when you asked her to marry you? That&#8217;s
what I want to know now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cherubic smile which was waiting for its
chance in Carfax&#8217;s eyes turned slowly into an
impish grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;As nearly as I can recall it, she said: &#8216;Most
certainly not. Why should I?&#8217; Of course, you
have guessed that I asked her merely to give
you a chance to be decently loyal to Elizabeth.
Miss Richardia took it as it was meant, and we
have been very good friends, playing the game
at odd moments for your benefit when you seemed
to be needing a bit of help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; you were very kind; you are all
very kind. But that doesn&#8217;t mend any broken
bridges for me now. Do you want me to tell
you why Richardia turned you and your ridiculous
fortune down so easily? I can, you know,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
and with that he told the story of his chance surprising
of Miss Birrell&#8217;s secret.</p>

<p>Carfax heard him through patiently and did not
seem unduly surprised at the new development.</p>

<p>&#8220;That accounts for a good many things,&#8221; he
commented. &#8220;I have had a feeling for some
time that Miss Richardia had something on her
mind&mdash;something not altogether joyous. Once
or twice she has seemed on the verge of confiding
in me. It&#8217;s a case of the obdurate father, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so; though Hartridge didn&#8217;t hint
at anything of that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Hartridge knows, too, does he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all know at Highmount, I fancy. And
that reminds me: I&#8217;ve done it again&mdash;talked too
much, as usual. I met Hartridge after I had seen
the pair of them together, and we spoke of the
love affair. Hartridge said it was Richardia&#8217;s
secret, and that her friends had been carefully
keeping it for her. I shouldn&#8217;t have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is safe enough with me, as you ought to
know: you will be the one to go and tell it all
over the lot,&#8221; was the unkind retort. And then:
&#8220;These letters of Elizabeth&#8217;s; she ought to have
them, don&#8217;t you think? Do you suppose I
might&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>Tregarvon waved him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The letters will be all the excuse you will
need for making two calls in the same half-day.
Take the car and go and do what you&#8217;re aching
to do. After you have sung your little song, you
may give Elizabeth my love and my blessing.
No, don&#8217;t stop to talk any more; just make your
little bow and vanish, before I get to thinking
too pointedly of all the things you&#8217;ve done to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax took his cue promptly, and before Tregarvon
had finished filling his pipe the roar of the
yellow car&#8217;s motor told him that the golden youth
had begun his flight to the mountain top. A
short half-hour later, at a second filling of the
pipe, the motor roar was repeated, and while the
solitary smoker was wondering what had brought
Carfax back so soon, the dining-room door opened
to admit Wilmerding.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are responsible,&#8221; said the young superintendent,
explaining the motor-car clamor. &#8220;You
gave me the fever, flaunting that big yellow devil
of yours in my face, and I was obliged to go and
buy. Want to take a little spin in the new wagon
to see how she handles?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon pushed a chair into the fire-warmed
semicircle for his visitor and shook his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>&#8220;Some other time&mdash;if you&#8217;ll be good enough to
let the invitation hang over. To-night I&#8217;d rather
sit here before the fire with you and have a little
heart-to-heart talk, Wilmerding. Will you indulge
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; was the ready response. &#8220;The joy-ride
can wait. Can you find me another pipe?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pipe was found and filled, and at its lighting
Tregarvon began without preface, giving the
steel-cube facts as they had been developed by
Tryon and linking them up with Thaxter&#8217;s apparently
disinterested effort to promote the sale
of the Ocoee to Consolidated Coal. &#8220;I&#8217;m telling
you this, Wilmerding, because I know you&#8217;re not
implicated,&#8221; he said in conclusion. &#8220;Also, because
it seems no more than fair that you should
know. I&#8217;m not specially vindictive, you understand.
I suppose Thaxter and the men behind
him are calling it nothing more than a bit of sharp
practice on purely legitimate business lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That might do for the drill-dulling,&#8221; the
superintendent conceded thoughtfully, &#8220;though
I&#8217;d take pretty violent exceptions to that, if I
were you. But doesn&#8217;t this one proved rascality
imply the authorship of all the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Hartridge thinks not, and so do I. By
a good, vigorous stretch of imagination you could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
call the drill-dulling something less than criminal.
But that can&#8217;t be said of the attempt to wreck my
motor-car, or of the risk taken of killing somebody
by the smashing of the machinery and the planting
of a dynamite cartridge in the engine-boiler.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the evening lengthened they discussed
the various phases of the mystery in all their
bearings, and in the end Wilmerding came around
to the Tryon-Hartridge hypothesis, namely, that
Thaxter, unscrupulous as he may have been in
bribing Sawyer, was not the instigator of the more
serious barbarities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I&#8217;m excusing Thaxter or the New
York office from which he has his instructions,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;The &#8216;Big Business&#8217; methods are all
more or less crooked, and I&#8217;d give half of my
salary if I didn&#8217;t have to work for an outfit that
simply won&#8217;t fight in the open, as men ought to
fight. Do you know, Tregarvon, I&#8217;ve been hoping
against hope that you&#8217;d strike it, and strike it
rich, on the Ocoee. In that case, I had made up
my mind to ask you to hire me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had a mine, you couldn&#8217;t ask anything
that would please me better,&#8221; said Tregarvon,
warming to this expression of friendly loyalty.
&#8220;But the thing looks pretty hopeless just now.
As I have said, Professor Hartridge knows more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
about the Ocoee than anybody else seems to&mdash;and
he won&#8217;t tell all he knows. But he did assure me
this afternoon that we are not going to find the
big vein where we are drilling in the old burying-ground,
and I have every reason to believe that
he was telling the truth. That lets me out.
Thaxter &#8217;phoned me this morning that he had got
the option extended until to-morrow midnight. I
stand to lose a hundred thousand dollars if I
take the time to move the drilling plant and try
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilmerding rose to go, returning the borrowed
pipe to its place on the mantel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hard proposition,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not going to advise you to throw up the chance
to get the hundred thousand. But if I were in
your shoes, I&#8217;d be just reckless enough to gamble
another throw or two. In this talk we&#8217;ve had,
you have convinced me of one thing, Tregarvon,
and that is that the Ocoee has a workable vein
somewhere in the property. Hartridge knows it,
and Consolidated Coal knows it. And what they
know, some other fellow can find out. You have
twenty-four hours, and a little better, in which to
think it over. I said I wouldn&#8217;t advise, but I
shall: don&#8217;t close with Thaxter one minute before
you are obliged to.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>Tregarvon got out of his chair to shake hands
with the departing visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a man, Wilmerding, and I wish I had
your nerve. But a couple of things have happened
to-day&mdash;things that I can&#8217;t talk about,
even to so good a friend as you are&mdash;and they
have knocked me out. At the end of the ends,
I&#8217;m afraid I shall weaken and sell out to your hog
of a trust. It was good of you to come down and
let me unload on you. If anything new turns
up I&#8217;ll get you on the wire. Good night, and good
luck to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Wilmerding had gone, Tregarvon sat for
another hour before the fire, smoking abstractedly
and hardly noting the passing of time. In due
course there was another flurry of gas-engine
noises, and when the clamor died away, Carfax
came in to fling himself into the chair where Wilmerding
had been sitting.</p>

<p>Tregarvon broke the silence morosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? You are not measuring up very strikingly
with the commonly accepted idea of the
happy lover. What&#8217;s the latest?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax had taken a cork-tipped cigarette from
his case and was absently trying to set fire to the
wrong end of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vance,&#8221; he said, in his gentlest tone, &#8220;you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
deserve to be murdered in cold blood. You told
me that Elizabeth hadn&#8217;t gotten that frenzied
letter you wrote her the day you were in Chattanooga.
She hadn&#8217;t, but it was merely delayed;
it was in that lot of forwarded mail that I took up
to-night, and I&mdash;<i>I</i> gave it to her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the latest, is it? Where does the
tragedy come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say another word or I shall explode!
You have probably forgotten that you wrote her
that I was as good as engaged to Richardia Birrell&mdash;it
would be quite like you to forget. She excused
herself to go and read her letters, and when
she came back I knew that the heavens had fallen.
Oh, no; there wasn&#8217;t any scene; she just simply
wouldn&#8217;t give me a chance to get a word in edgewise,
though I tried for a solid hour to make the
chance. I&#8217;m ruined for life&mdash;and you, with your
nimble little pen and your neat facility for telling
all you know, and then some, <i>you</i> had to be the
one to mangle me!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI<br />


<small>Tryon&#8217;s News</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TREGARVON awoke on the Monday morning
with the feeling of the putative bankrupt
who is facing his final day of grace. Before
midnight the bargain-and-sale decision must be
made; and he knew perfectly well that there
would be no chance in the short interval which
still remained of adding to the facts as they stood.
Nevertheless, after Carfax had disappeared, walking,
in the direction of Hesterville, Tregarvon
plunged into the routine, entering into a wire correspondence
with the Chattanooga machinery firm
and trying to extort a promise that the needed
valve and steam-pipe should be shipped without
fail by the afternoon train.</p>

<p>Since Carfax did not put in an appearance for the
noon meal, Tregarvon ate alone. While he was
at table Tryon came in to report. Early in the
morning the man Sawyer had turned up at the
drilling ground with a one-horse wagon and had
taken his belongings, including the working-coat,
and the tool-box, containing among other things
the reserve supply of steel cubes. Tryon was of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
the opinion that the drill boss was preparing to
vanish, and suggested the taking of preventive
measures. Though Sawyer would doubtless be a
most unwilling witness, it might be needful to make
sure that he could be found when wanted.</p>

<p>Tregarvon concurred mechanically, telling the
foreman to spread an unofficial drag-net for Sawyer,
and agreeing to swear out a warrant for the
man&#8217;s arrest if he should attempt to run away.
Beyond this, he sent one of the laborers up to the
drilling-stand to give Rucker a chance to sleep;
and, later in the afternoon, sent word to Tryon&#8217;s
house directing the foreman to share the coming
night-watch with the mechanician; all this also
as a matter of routine, since, with the suspension
of working operations, there had been no threats
of further aggressions.</p>

<p>Just before the evening meal Carfax returned
abstracted and silent, and saying nothing as to
the manner in which he had spent the day. Immediately
after dinner he asked Tregarvon if he
might have the motor-car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going up to Westwood House to try again?&#8221;
queried the motor-car&#8217;s owner, not too sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no good to you here,&#8221; was the non-committal
rejoinder; and a little later Tregarvon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
found himself facing the approaching crisis alone
and still undecided.</p>

<p>Thaxter had telephoned during the afternoon,
calling attention once more to the terms of the
offer to purchase. The message had taken the
tone of a friendly warning. There was no hope
of securing further delay, but the bookkeeper
would give Tregarvon the benefit of all the time
that remained. He would stay in his Whitlow
office, or be within call, up to midnight, and he
hoped that Tregarvon would be sensible and remember
the old saw about the bird in the hand.</p>

<p>Tregarvon was remembering the canny proverb&mdash;and
a good many other things&mdash;when he lighted
his after-dinner pipe. Throughout the entire
day he had been wavering and postponing the
moment of action. One hundred thousand dollars,
judiciously invested, would provide an income
for his mother and sister, which, however
far it might fall short of the former Tregarvon
lavishnesses, would still place them securely beyond
the hazard of want. On the other hand, a
certain innate obstinacy, grown now to a passion
which threatened to drive cool-blood reason to the
wall, refused to yield.</p>

<p>Apart from this, there was a question of pure
ethics to be considered. Quite early in the attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
to develop the Ocoee he had secretly determined,
if his efforts should prove successful,
to reorganize the company, taking in those who
had suffered loss; in other words, to make restitution
to Parker&#8217;s victims. But if the property
should be sold to the trust there was an end of
the generous intention, and the nail of injustice
driven by Parker would be irrevocably clinched.</p>

<p>These were some of the perplexities, but there
was another which also demanded a hearing.
Carfax had been most generous and loyal, spending
not only his money but himself. But now the
conditions were changed&mdash;or changing. Carfax
had another interest, suddenly grown imperative.
Would it not be most unfair to drag him still
deeper into the discouraging fight, allowing him
to spend more money which might never be repaid?</p>

<p>At this point in the reflective probings Tregarvon
began to argue that he must see and talk
with Carfax again before he could decide finally
and definitely; and he had no sooner reached this
conclusion, and was casting about for the means
to translate it into action, when Wilmerding appeared&mdash;a
veritable god-in-the-machine, since he
was driving his new car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thaxter was telling me that you&#8217;d most likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
be making him a business call this evening, and I
thought I&#8217;d drive over and take you back in my
car,&#8221; said the newly made motor enthusiast.
&#8220;If I&#8217;m butting in, don&#8217;t scruple to chase me
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was already taking his driving-coat
from its closet in the fireplace corner. &#8220;You
have come precisely in the nick of time,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;Carfax has taken my car to drive to
Westwood House, and I must have a few minutes&#8217;
talk with him before I fight the final round with
Thaxter. Will your car climb the big hill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it won&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll scrap it and buy another,&#8221;
laughed the Pittsburgher; and five minutes later
the new, high-powered roadster was storming up
the Pisgah grades.</p>

<p>Eight minutes was the time to the Highmount
gates, and Tregarvon called it a beat, though he
had never timed his own car over the same distance.
Eight other minutes covered the cross-mountain
run to the western brow; and it was not
until Wilmerding had tooled the roadster up the
Westwood House driveway and was parking it
beside the yellow touring-car that Tregarvon
began to wonder if, with Elizabeth as her guest,
Richardia would not be breaking her school
routine by spending her evenings at home. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
that case ... but it was now too late to retreat,
and, with Wilmerding at his elbow, he ran up
the steps to set the old-fashioned knocker of the
great door clanging its drumbeat through the
echoing interiors.</p>

<p>When Aunt Phyllis, the solemn-faced old negress
who was the sole survivor of the once numerous
household retinue, opened the drawing-room
doors for the two callers, the judge&#8217;s daughter was
at the piano, the judge was listening luxuriously
in a deep, calico-covered armchair, and Carfax
was sitting with Miss Wardwell in a window-seat
at the farther end of the room.</p>

<p>Wilmerding made his own and Tregarvon&#8217;s
apologies when the judge got upon his feet to
welcome the newcomers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were taking a spin in my new car,&#8221; he explained,
tactfully leaving Tregarvon&#8217;s errand unmentioned.
&#8220;Of course, we couldn&#8217;t pass your
hospitable door, Judge Birrell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, suh; most suttainly you couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; was
the ready response. &#8220;The do-ahs of old Westwood
House may creak a little on thei-uh hinges,
suh, but they still swing wide enough to let the
guest enter at his pleas-yuh. Find yo-uh places,
gentlemen, if you please; my daughtuh is giving
us a little music.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>Miss Wardwell had risen, with Carfax backgrounding
her because he was obliged to, and Tregarvon
introduced Wilmerding as a fellow Pennsylvanian
from the Pittsburgh end of the State.
Elizabeth was pleasantly gracious to the young
superintendent of coal mines, seeming to welcome
him as in some sort a saver of situations; at least,
so it appeared to Tregarvon. In the readjustment
the judge sank back into the depths of his
armchair, and Carfax surrendered his place in
the window-seat to Wilmerding and wandered to
another window to stand with his back to the
room and his hands in his pockets. This was
Tregarvon&#8217;s opportunity to say the needed word
to the golden youth, but at its offering a sudden
passionate impulse seized him and he crossed
quickly to the piano alcove. &#8220;I see you have my
nocturne,&#8221; he whispered, bending over the pianist
and indicating the Chopin on the piano-desk;
&#8220;please play it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if his masterful mood were not to be safely
denied, her fingers fell upon the keys in the opening
chords of the nocturne; and this was the
beginning of what gradually grew to be an interval
of suspended possibilities. Almost at once,
Tregarvon realized that Richardia was playing
only from the fingers outward&mdash;faultlessly, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
mechanically; that Carfax was wandering from
one window to another in a sort of aimless unrest;
that Elizabeth was setting all her serene traditions
at defiance by chatting eagerly, like an escaped
school-girl, with Wilmerding.</p>

<p>A few minutes further along, when Carfax
dragged a chair into the window recess and deliberately
broke in upon Miss Wardwell and her
companion, the spirit of disquietude seemed to
seize upon the judge, also, since he wheeled his armchair
to face the window group and did violence
to all the Westwood House musical unities by
joining in the low-toned conversation. This gave
Tregarvon his excuse; and when the nocturne
ran away at its close into delicate little improvisations,
he spoke again in the guarded undertone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hartridge may have told you that I accidentally
surprised your secret yesterday afternoon.
I did, you know; but I want you to be assured
that it is as safe with me as it is with the professor,
or with any of your friends who know
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he were expecting any manifestation of surprise
it was not forthcoming. So far from it, there
was no break in the improvisation harmonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day I hope it won&#8217;t be necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
make a secret of it,&#8221; she replied evenly, matching
his low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Elizabeth know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. But I shall tell her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she told you that our engagement is
broken?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her nod was barely perceptible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope she told you that I didn&#8217;t break it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she told me that, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not saying it, but deep down in your
heart you are telling yourself that I have got only
what was coming to me. Isn&#8217;t that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer came from lips that were paling a
little. &#8220;Ask yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> true. And it is also true, perhaps, that
I should have had this other whipping; the one
I got yesterday afternoon when I was trying to
meet Hartridge on his way back from the
&#8216;Pocket.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was still keeping her face averted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk about that now, to any one&mdash;least
of all, to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent lower to make sure that the group at
the other end of the room should not overhear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to meet the man. If I stay here on
Mount Pisgah&mdash;if I don&#8217;t throw it all up and go
home&mdash;I mean to do what I can to help. Once I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
shouldn&#8217;t have been big enough to say such a
thing, Richardia; but&mdash;thank God&mdash;I&#8217;ve grown
a little in the past few months. May I add that
it is you who have shown me how to grow?&#8221;</p>

<p>She ignored the query and for the first time let
him see her eyes: they were swimming, and there
was a note in her voice that he had never heard
before when she said: &#8220;You must not talk of
giving up and going away; you are the one who
can do the most to help when the time comes&mdash;if
only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A clamorous banging of the door-knocker interrupted,
and Aunt Phyllis put her turbaned head
into the drawing-room to say, with her fat chin
in the air and a fine scorn in her tone: &#8220;Po&#8217; white
man at de front do&#8217;, comed to ast faw Mistoo
Tregarbin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon obeyed the summons rather reluctantly
and found Tryon on the veranda. The
foreman had been running and was short of
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come over&mdash;you an&#8217; Mr. Carfax,&#8221;
he broke out hurriedly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve done caught the
dannymiter. He was aimin&#8217; to blow us all to
kingdom come, this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Tregarvon grated.</p>

<p>Tryon wagged his head mysteriously. &#8220;Hit
ain&#8217;t Sawyer; hit&#8217;s the same skunk I been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
a-suspicionin&#8217; ever sense we had that talk yisterday.
You&#8217;ll see when you get thar&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon went back to the drawing-room,
meaning to cut Carfax out if possible without
giving a general alarm. But Wilmerding overheard
his whispered explanation to Carfax and
so did Miss Wardwell; whereupon he spoke up
quickly, briefing the story of the Ocoee troubles,
and adding its latest sequel. The effect upon the
master of Westwood House was instantaneous
and militant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, suh? Tryin&#8217; to dynamite yo-uh
machinery whilst you and Mistuh Carfax are
makin&#8217; us a friendly visit heah at Westwood
House?&#8221; he demanded, his deep voice rumbling
in the wrath of outraged hospitality. &#8220;Richa&#8217;dia,
daughtuh, get me my coat and hat; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; oveh
yondeh with these young gentlemen. No, Mistuh
Tregarvon; don&#8217;t deny me that privilege, suh;
yo-uh bein&#8217; undeh my roof at the precise moment
makes yo-uh quarrel <i>my</i> quarrel, suh! You&#8217;ll
give me a seat in yo-uh steam-wagon, and&mdash;daughtuh,
my coat and hat, immediately, if you
please. And fetch me the old shot-gun, too, my
deah.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Wilmerding was declaring that he
must not be left out; and in the momentary confusion
Tregarvon saw that the judge&#8217;s daughter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
while she was obeying her father&#8217;s commands, was
pitiably agitated. Assuming that her anxiety
was for her father&#8217;s safety, he ventured a word
of assurance while she was holding the overcoat
for the sleeves of which the judge was hastily
fumbling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t distress yourself&mdash;we are not
going to let your father get hurt,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s not that!&#8221; she gasped; &#8220;it is something
far worse.&#8221; Then, in an agonized whisper
that he had to bend lower to hear: &#8220;This man
they have taken; promise me that you will let
him go before my&mdash;before any one else has seen
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon promised blindly, striving to ignore
this last of the maddening mysteries in an effort
to be wholly loyal to the woman he loved. But
as he committed himself the difficulties in the way
of performance suddenly magnified themselves.
With the judge taking part in the descent upon
the scene of the capture, how was he to be kept
from seeing and questioning the culprit? Tregarvon
saw that he had promised that which he
would most probably be unable to perform, but
in the confusion of the hurried departure there
was no chance to add the qualifying word, and
it was left unspoken.</p>

<small>Cloud-Wraiths</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH Judge Birrell urging haste, the start
for the burying-ground glade was made
at once. Since Tregarvon&#8217;s car was large enough
to hold them all, Wilmerding&#8217;s roadster was left
behind. Carfax drove the touring-car, with Tryon
clutching for handholds in the mechanician&#8217;s seat
beside him. This arrangement left the broad tonneau
seat for the other three; and the judge,
with the gun between his knees, sat in the middle.
When the big car shot away with its loading the
master of Westwood was still calling down maledictions
upon the heads of those who would besmirch
the fair fame of the Southland by resorting
to the methods of the assassin and the anarchist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are these scoundrels, Mistuh Tregarvon?&#8221;
he demanded. &#8220;Just name me thei-uh names,
suh!&#8221; And then, with the charming inconsistency
of his kind: &#8220;This is a law-abiding community,
suh, and you have wronged us by keeping
silence so long; you have, for a fact, suh! But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
now we shall vindicate ou&#8217;selves. A little taste
of a rope and a tree limb for this grand rascal
yo-uh men have caught will make him tell us the
names of his confederates and accomplices; and
then, by the Lord Harry, suh, we&#8217;ll run these
lawbreakuhs down with the dogs and hang them
higheh than Haman!&#8221;</p>

<p>During the hurried cross-mountain run Tregarvon
wrestled manfully with the problem
thrust upon him by Richardia Birrell&#8217;s whispered
appeal. How was he to prevent a meeting between
the judge and the as yet unnamed man
whom Tryon and Rucker had captured? The
query was still unanswered when the yellow car
skidded and slued around the turn into the old
wood road. Despite the promise given by a
fair day and a measurably clear evening, the night
had suddenly thickened, with cloud wracks flying
low over the mountain top to wrap the forest
in mantlings of fleecy vapor silver-shot by the
rays of a gibbous moon, but opposing a wall
of blank opacity to the headlamps of the car.
Tregarvon would have welcomed help from the
chapter of accidents, but now that they were off
the main road there was a fair chance that the
accident might be too destructive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, Poictiers!&mdash;you&#8217;ll scrap us if you don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
look out!&#8221; he cautioned, leaning forward to warn
Carfax, who was boring into the cloud bank at
reckless speed.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely uttered before there
came a crunching of dry tree limbs under the
wheels, a hiss of escaping air, and a jolting stoppage
of the car as the brakes were applied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Punctured!&#8221; exclaimed the cautioner, and
they all got out to investigate cause and consequence.
The obstruction proved to be what it
had seemed&mdash;the dry limb of a tree&mdash;and the result
was a flat tire.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is dead wood, and it may have fallen of its
own accord; or it may mean that your dynamiter
has friends who would like to delay us,&#8221; Wilmerding
offered. &#8220;On the bare chance, hadn&#8217;t we
better sprint along and not wait to change tires?
Your man, Rucker, may easily be having the time
of his life trying to hold on to his prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sprinted accordingly, the judge taking
the dog-trot as actively as his younger pace-setters,
and stubbornly refusing to let Tregarvon
relieve him of the burden of the heavy deer-gun.
So running, they came in a few minutes to the
site of the old burying-ground, and to the door
of the tool shanty. Rucker admitted them at
Tregarvon&#8217;s knock and call, and his report was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
brief and unenlightening. &#8220;No; nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;
since we took him in&mdash;and the cuss won&#8217;t talk.
But maybe you can make him loosen up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon still saw no way of keeping the judge
out of it, and he held himself absolved from his
promise by the sheer impossibility of doing what
Richardia had begged him to do. The captive,
wrist-bound with a turn or two of cord, was
sitting hunched upon the edge of Rucker&#8217;s cot-bed.
It was Carfax who picked up the lantern
and flashed its light into the man&#8217;s face. &#8220;By
Jove!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;Morgan McNabb!&#8221; and
Rucker nodded.</p>

<p>Judge Birrell sat upon the spare coil of rope and
wiped his face with his handkerchief. His hands
were trembling and he was breathing hard, but
the smart run from the disabled automobile might
have accounted for these disturbances. When he
spoke to the prisoner his tone was sternly accusing.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s you, is it, Mo&#8217;gan McNabb?&mdash;turnin&#8217;
yo-uh teeth upon the hand that&#8217;s been feedin&#8217;
you? By the Lord Harry, you make me mighty
sorry that I once saved you from going to the
penitentiary, where you belong! Now, then, open
yo-uh mouth and tell these gentlemen why you
come heah dynamitin&#8217; thei-uh machinery!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>The mountaineer&#8217;s lips were drawn back in a
doglike snarl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see &#8217;em damned befo&#8217; I&#8217;ll open my haid
to &#8217;em, now, Judge Birrell! Lookee at this yere,&#8221;
and he wrenched his tied hands around so that
the judge might see.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like the rope?&#8221; said the judge
evenly. &#8220;Listen to me, Mo&#8217;gan; you McNabbs
have lived on Westwood land, father and son, for
fo&#8217; generations, and you&#8217;ll open yo-uh head to me,
suh! What quarrel have you got with the owneh
of the Ocoee property? Ansuh me, if you don&#8217;t
want anotheh tu&#8217;n o&#8217; that rope taken around
yo-uh neck, suh!&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was as prompt as it was disconcerting.
&#8220;I allow I got thess the same sort o&#8217; quarrel
ez you have, judge. Didn&#8217;t they-all steal the
Ocoee f&#8217;om you in the first place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s neithuh heah nor there!&#8221; was the stern
rejoinder. &#8220;Would you give these gentlemen to
understand that <i>I</i> am yo-uh principal in these
scandalous outrages? See heah, Mo&#8217;gan, we all
know that you haven&#8217;t been actin&#8217; on yo-uh own
responsibility. Who has been puttin&#8217; you up to
all these deviltries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t know, I reckon <i>I</i> ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to
be the one to tell you,&#8221; said the prisoner, relapsing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
into his former attitude of sullenness. Then, as if
upon a second thought: &#8220;You ask Miss Dick,
judge; I allow <i>she</i> knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little pause of consternation which this
statement precipitated was broken by an exclamation
from Rucker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out yonder! Somebody&#8217;s set the leaves
afire! My God! we left the dynamite out there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax, who was standing beside the mechanician,
wheeled quickly to face the open door. Out
beyond the drill derrick a thin line of fire, driven
by the freshening west wind and showing orange-colored
under the mist-wraiths, was sweeping
down upon the clearing. &#8220;Show me where you
left the stuff!&#8221; he snapped at the mechanician,
but even as he spoke, a fuse squibbed and the
thunder of a terrific explosion shattered the forest
silences, the concussion smashing the glass in the
small square window, rocking the lightly built
tool-house like the heaving of an earthquake, and
bombarding it an instant later with a rain of
falling <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. The judge, sitting upon the coil
of rope, was not thrown down, but the five men
who were standing were flung in a heap on the
floor.</p>

<p>Tregarvon was the first to regain his feet and
to reach the open. The cloud mantlings had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
thrust aside for the moment, but the stir was full
of gray dust and acrid with the fumes of the explosive.
Where the derrick and the new power-plant
had stood there was a mass of tangled
wreckage, and the burying-ground glade looked
as if it had been swept by a tornado. In the wan
moonlight Tregarvon caught a glimpse of something
moving under the trees beyond the wreck;
then the moving object erected itself into the
stature of a man.</p>

<p>One glance at the tall, frock-coated figure was
enough. With a mad yell of rage, Tregarvon
snatched the gun from the judge&#8217;s hands and
gave chase, calling to the frock-coated man to
stand or he would shoot. There was an instant
of hesitation, seemingly of indecision; then the
man turned and fled. And, as if to favor him,
another scudding cloud settled upon the mountain top,
burying forest and glade, the tangled
wreck and the two runners in its fleecy depths.</p>

<p>Tregarvon raced on for a breath-cutting space;
guided solely by the crashing of the fugitive
through the brier tangles and dry-leaf beds. Then
he began to get his second wind, and again he
shouted the command to halt. Since this seemed
only to have the effect of hastening the thudding
footsteps on ahead, he fired the gun, holding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
muzzle high, as he thought and intended, but apparently
not high enough, as the dreadful sequence
immediately indicated. For, almost exactly
coincident with the report of the gun, there
was a shriek, the crash of a falling body, and
silence.</p>

<p>At this the pursuer came down from the transporting
heights of berserk rage with a shock that
was sickening. &#8220;Oh, good Lord!&#8221; he gasped;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve killed him!&#8221; Whereupon he flung the
offending weapon afar and ran to confirm the
horrifying conclusion.</p>

<p>He was still running in the direction from which
the cry had come when the curious happening
befell. As if the solid earth had been whisked
away from beneath his feet he found himself
whirling through empty space; falling through
unfathomable depths of it, it seemed, before he
collided with another world&mdash;a world of shocks
and coruscating pains, of beatings and bruisings,
and presently of grateful forgetfulness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII<br />


<small>The Ocoee&#8217;s Answer</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Tregarvon recovered consciousness he
knew at once what had happened to him.
In the blind and hurried search for the body of
the man he had presumptively shot he had fallen
from the cliff edge; how far was still problematical,
but far enough, as a painful roaring in his
ears, a tightening agony in his forehead, and a
bruised and stiffening ankle sufficiently testified.</p>

<p>His first thought was for his victim. The man
might not have been killed outright; in which
case he might be even now dying for the lack of
timely help. The thought was insupportable
and Tregarvon tried to rise. But the ankle,
broken or twisted, he could not determine which,
gripped him like a fanged wild beast and he fell
back with a groan. None the less, in some way
he must contrive to bring help. He felt in his
pockets for matches. A heap of dry leaves furnished
the kindling and a clear flame leaped up,
hollowing out a small cavity of yellow light in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
misty gloom. At this the fire-lighter saw that he
was at the bottom of a deep, water-worn cleft
opening back from the outer scarp of the cliff,
and at right angles to it; a ravine which was little
more than a crevice, save that it was large enough
to have trees and shrubs growing in it.</p>

<p>He knew the crevice, though he had never explored
it. It lay at a point almost exactly half-way
between the glade and the tramhead. Knowing
that the sound would not carry upward and
backward over the cliff, he did not waste his
breath in vain shoutings. The alternative was a
fire signal. If the cloud would but lift a little, and
he could gather enough of the dry leaves to make a
glow, the light would guide those who must certainly,
by this time, be searching for him.</p>

<p>This was his thought while he was nursing the
handful of fire and adding more leaves to it. The
blaze rose higher and the cavity in the gloom
grew larger until it became a hemisphere, with the
black scarp of the crevice wall for its flattened
side. A thickly matted vine covered the face of
the precipice, completely concealing the perpendicular
surface upon which it climbed. At its
roots in the crevice bottom the dry leaves were
bedded a foot deep. Tregarvon was reaching
painfully for the mass of fresh fuel when the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
licked out and caught it first. There was a puff
of dense smoke, a fierce blaze, and then the climbing
vine took fire and was brightly outlined in a
network of short-lived flame.</p>

<p>All this was normal enough, but what followed
was curiously abnormal. As the fire glowed hotter
small fragments of the cliff face began to split off,
and these fragments, falling into the burning leaf-bed,
sprang alight with hissings and sputterings
and much pungent smoke. Tregarvon, ignoring
the throbbing ankle, dragged himself an agonizing
foot or so nearer and secured one of the splintered
fragments. <i>It was coal!</i></p>

<p>Almost beside himself with excitement, he
heaped more leaves upon the fire. By the light
of the fresh upblaze he could make out the upper
line of the great coal seam. It was at the height
of a tall man&#8217;s head above the bottom of the cleft,
well-defined, unmistakable; the roof shale of a
vein fully six feet thick. Here, discovered in the
moment of defeat, disaster, and woundings, was
the Ocoee&#8217;s lavish answer to all the costly questionings.</p>

<p>&#8220;My heavens!&#8221; gasped the discoverer; and a
voice, apparently at his elbow, said: &#8220;Quite so;
if the heavens may be purchased with the gifts
of the earth. The gifts are yours, Mr. Tregarvon;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
first by the right of inheritance, and now by the
right of discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon twisted himself into a sitting posture,
gritting his teeth at the ankle&#8217;s protest and
holding his head in his hands. At a little distance
away sat the professor of mathematics, one long
leg jack-knifed for a support, and the other
stretched awkwardly upon a makeshift cushion of
the fallen leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; Tregarvon cried. &#8220;Did you fall over
the cliff, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was I who showed you the way,&#8221;
Hartridge amended. &#8220;You are a very apt pupil,
Mr. Tregarvon. I was scarcely well down here
before you played the part of Jill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;are you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by your shot-gun charge, happily; but
my leg is broken. And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon winced. &#8220;I have a cracked skull, I
think, and an ankle that won&#8217;t let me get up. But
about that gunshot; I didn&#8217;t fire at you; I shot
into the air to make you stop. Just the same, you
gave me a quick fit of the horrors. When you
yelled, I thought I had inadvertently killed you.
What made you run?&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor&#8217;s smile was a little rueful, and
also a little shamefaced.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_400.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;My heavens!&#8221; gasped the discoverer; and a voice,<br />
apparently at his elbow, said: &#8220;Quite so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>&#8220;What made you chase me?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I was hot&mdash;fighting mad. I wanted
to drag you to an accounting on the spot. I don&#8217;t
suppose you will be foolish enough to deny that
you set the leaf fire that caused the explosion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I was near enough to be blown up myself
such a denial might have the weight of circumstantial
evidence to support it,&#8221; was the
quiet reply. &#8220;But I do not make the denial.
It was I who set the leaves afire. I shall be greatly
relieved if you can tell me that nobody was injured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I know the dynamite didn&#8217;t kill any
of us. But tell me, did you start that fire knowing
that the explosion would follow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means. I may confess that I knew the
dynamite had been placed; but I supposed, as the
most ordinary matter of course, that your men
had taken care of it when they captured their
prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you light the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the quaint smile flitted across the face of
the man who had always contrived to tell less
than the sum total of all he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once again, Mr. Tregarvon, you are going into
the question of motives, which is a very large
field, indeed. Let us say that I wished to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
a diversion of some sort. Will that satisfy
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the blunt reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry; I am afraid it will have to suffice
for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s head was throbbing so painfully
that he found it next to impossible to think
clearly. But he would not desist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hartridge, it has come to a show-down between
us. I&#8217;m giving you fair warning. Once I
did you an injustice&mdash;or thought I did&mdash;but this
time you&#8217;ve given yourself away. When I get
up and around again, I&#8217;m going to sift this thing
to the ultimate bottom and somebody will be
made to sweat blood for what has been done to-night.
As matters stand now, you seem to be the
man the officers will want first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the professor smiled. &#8220;And yet
you can&#8217;t say that I have ever wittingly done
anything to harm you,&#8221; he offered mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That remains to be proved,&#8221; was the angry
retort. &#8220;Meaning to, or not meaning to, you fired
that dynamite a little while back; and you certainly
have never strained yourself in any effort
to help me. You knew that this big vein was here&mdash;you
have known it all along!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This time you are not my guest, Mr. Tregarvon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
and I may contradict you without blame.
I did not know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you carve the Greek letter <i>pi</i>
on those two oak-trees below the glade? Or do
you deny that, as well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you who have found the value of <i>pi</i>,&#8221;
said the one who was under accusation. &#8220;I am
ashamed to confess that it baffled me. Some
three years ago, two strange surveyors acting, as
I learned afterward, in the interests of Consolidated
Coal, ran many lines over this property of
yours, which was then practically abandoned.
I had no access to their note-books, of course, so
I was obliged to work out my conclusions as best
I could from their stakes. One of these conclusions
was that the true vein would be found somewhere
in this locality. Can you believe me thus far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to,&#8221; said Tregarvon. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is humiliating to have to acknowledge
that, while all the line-running on the part of
these strangers pointed to this immediate locality,
I could never discover the outcrop. True, I
never thought of looking in this particular crevice.
But to preserve a record for possible future
investigation, I made the marks on the two
trees. The distance between the oaks, carefully
measured and multiplied by <i>pi</i>, or three and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
decimal one thousand, four hundred and sixteen,
gives the distance around the cliff from the lower
oak to the point somewhere below us where the
intruding strangers drove their final stake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon heaped more leaves upon the fire,
which was threatening to die out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still miles beyond my comprehension,&#8221;
he complained moodily. &#8220;On one hand,
you stop at nothing to prevent me from finding
out what you have just told me, and on the other
you make what appears to be a very worthy
and earnest effort to keep me from flinging myself
into the maw of Consolidated Coal. How am
I to reconcile such things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you are older, Mr. Tregarvon, and come
to know human nature a little better, you will
apprehend the truth of that worldly wise beatitude,
&#8216;Blessed are they who expect little, for,
verily, they shall not be disappointed.&#8217; Consider
a moment: you came here, the legal owner of
the Ocoee, to be sure, and the innocent owner,
inasmuch as your father was the unsuspecting
purchaser of stolen goods. Yet you were none the
less the legitimate successor of the bandit who
had looted us. You wouldn&#8217;t expect much from
those who had been so ruthlessly defrauded,
would you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>&#8220;Since I was not even constructively to blame,
yes,&#8221; Tregarvon insisted stubbornly. &#8220;Your
motive went deeper than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did,&#8221; the professor admitted gravely. &#8220;Almost
from the first I saw the slight chance of a
reward, the attainment of which has been the one
thing desirable in a rather drab-colored life, slipping
away from me; taken away from me in sheer
wantonness, as it seemed, since, I had been given
to understand, you were already pledged to marry
Miss Wardwell. It was not in human nature to
be entirely unresentful, Mr. Tregarvon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh; so that was it?&#8221; said Tregarvon shortly.
Then: &#8220;What I saw yesterday afternoon in the
forest back of Westwood House seems to prove
that I am as far out of the running as you are with
Judge Birrell&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor&#8217;s face became, for the moment, a
study in astoundment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;yes,&#8221; he said, stumbling over the words;
and then: &#8220;I am to infer that you didn&#8217;t recognize
the young man whom you saw with Miss Richardia
yesterday afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he was a stranger to me. Doesn&#8217;t the
judge approve of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the professor&#8217;s smile was rather grim.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not&mdash;most decidedly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>&#8220;But Richardia loves him; and that is enough&mdash;for
you and for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly she loves him&mdash;very loyally,&#8221; was
the grave reply; and a moment later, as if the
mention of the judge had evoked a new train of
thought: &#8220;I am curious to know if my leaf-fire
diversion&mdash;which had such unlooked-for and disastrous
results&mdash;came soon enough. How much
had Morgan McNabb confessed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon ignored the brow-wrinkling of pain
which accompanied the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am beginning to believe that you are a very
hardened criminal, Mr. Hartridge. If you know
that McNabb had a confession to make, it follows
that you were his accomplice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was a suppressed groan, for which
the schoolmaster instantly apologized.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you must forgive me if I say that I
can&#8217;t go into the matter of culpability with you
just now. This leg&mdash;of mine&mdash;grows a bit insistent.
But it will be the greatest possible satisfaction
to me if you will answer my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; you shall have it. Just before the
explosion came McNabb had admitted that he
was acting for somebody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he did not name the person?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The judge was trying to make him do so, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
he was still refusing. The last thing he said, as
I remember it, was something which seemed to
implicate Miss Richardia as the one who could
tell if she chose. Which was absurd, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; was the low-voiced reply. &#8220;Shall
we let the matter rest there&mdash;for the present?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was holding his head in his hands
again. The throbbing pain was so intense that
he could only grit his teeth and endure. When
speech became possible he gave his answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may rest until I am able to take hold again.
Then I shall make somebody pay for this night&#8217;s
work if it takes every dollar I can dig out of the
Ocoee for the next ten years!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Hartridge bent in apparent agony
over the broken leg. But when the paroxysm
had passed he looked up with a face that was
gray with a deeper suffering than that inflicted
by the broken bone.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do; if you strike back in the spirit of
reprisal, which seems so justifiable to you now, you
will carry the woundings of your own vindictiveness
to your grave, Mr. Tregarvon,&#8221; he said solemnly.</p>

<p>Tregarvon did not comment upon the sober
prophecy. He was heaping more leaves upon the
fire and wondering irritably why it was taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
the rescuers so long to find them. The hammering
agony in his head climaxed now at shorter
intervals and the recurrences were blinding, but
he contrived to keep the leaf glow alive until a
welcome shout from the cliff above announced
the presence of the searchers.</p>

<p>The hauling of the two injured men out of the
deep cleft proved to be a difficult undertaking,
this though there were five in the rescue party,
which included the freed McNabb. Once it was
done, a stretcher was quickly improvised for
Hartridge, with Rucker, Tryon, and McNabb to
take turns as bearers; and Tregarvon made shift
to help himself a little, with Wilmerding and Carfax
to shoulder him on either side.</p>

<p>On the slow progress back to the glade Tregarvon
realized vaguely that his companions were
gravely silent; and as the lagging procession issued
from the wood he saw the cause. Rucker,
or some one, had replaced the deflated tire and the
motor-car had been brought upon the scene.
The white glare of its headlamps focused upon
the open space in front of the tool shanty. Judge
Birrell, bowed and shrunken, was sitting upon the
tool-house door-step with his face hidden in his
hands; and on Rucker&#8217;s cot-bed, which had been
placed under the light of the headlamps, lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
the body of a man covered with one of the
blankets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Tregarvon muttered, leaning
more heavily upon his helpers.</p>

<p>He thought it singular that no one answered
him, and the thought swiftly became an irritation
too keen to be borne.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil is the matter with you all?&#8221;
he rasped, with a curious idea that he had to
shout to make his voice heard above the deafening
thunder of many cataracts in his brain. Then,
as in a dream, he seemed to hear Wilmerding
saying to Carfax, almost savagely: &#8220;Ease him
down and we&#8217;ll carry him. Can&#8217;t you see he&#8217;s
gone off his head?&#8221;</p>

<small>Beyond the Gap</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a full fortnight before the Hesterville
physician, driven at breakneck speed to Coalville
in Wilmerding&#8217;s roadster on the night of
woundings, pronounced Tregarvon out of danger
and in a fair way to recover from the broken
head.</p>

<p>Whatever the lapse of time may have meant
for others, it had little significance for the man
who tossed and rolled in his bed in an upper room
of the Ocoee office-building. Dim pictures there
were of people coming and going; of grotesque
attendants lifting him about, these sometimes
parading as liveried Merkleys with Uncle William
heads, or the reverse; of faces, affectionately
sorrowful, hanging over him, now hopefully, and
again with sharp anxiety in eyes which were never
completely recognizable.</p>

<p>But for the greater interval, what with thundering
brain cataracts to attend to, and a thousand
dancing lights which had to be wheeled in vanishing
spirals, checked, stopped, and wheeled the
other way around precisely three hundred twirls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
a minute, he was so pressed for time as not to be
aware of the lapse of it. Hence, when he finally
opened eyes of full consciousness upon the walls
and ceiling of the familiar room, he was sadly out
of touch, his latest clear recollection being of a
cloud-banked night, of a glade in the mountain-top
forest, and of two great white eyes of artificial
light staring down upon a cot-bed bier supporting
a blanketed body.</p>

<p>At first he thought he was alone in the bare-walled
upper room, but at his earliest conscious
stirring Carfax came to stand beside the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better&mdash;much better!&#8221; said the golden
one, noting the turning-point improvement at
once. &#8220;You certainly had us guessing, old man.
Our only comfort has been in the fact that you
could eat and didn&#8217;t seem to be losing too much
flesh. Have the wheels stopped buzzing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t wheels; they were lights and
waterfalls,&#8221; said the sick man meticulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; call &#8217;em anything you like, so long
as they&#8217;re gone. We had one doctor, a specialist
from Nashville, who gave us a fit of seasickness;
said you&#8217;d live, and be all right physically, but
that you would most probably never recover your
reason. Nice cheerful prospect for the friends and
relatives, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>&#8220;How long have I been knocked out, Poictiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two solid weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother and sister&mdash;has anybody written
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! Elizabeth has been writing them every
day or so. They wanted to come down, of course,
but we decided that it wasn&#8217;t best. You were
getting all the care you could stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Elizabeth hasn&#8217;t gone home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Her father and mother have gone
to Florida, and she has been staying on at Westwood
House&mdash;what time she hasn&#8217;t been down
here coddling you. She&#8217;s an angel, Vance; one
of the kind you read about. But I mustn&#8217;t let
you talk too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t talk, you&#8217;ll have to. Have you
made it up with Elizabeth&mdash;about that silly side-play
of yours with Richardia?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax&#8217;s smile began on the cherubic lines but
it ended in a mere face-wrinkling of soberness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had too much else to think about;
too many little diversions, as you might say.
But I&#8217;m hoping she isn&#8217;t going to insist upon
making a horrible example of me for my apparent
fickleness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Too many little diversions&#8217;,&#8221; Tregarvon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
echoed. &#8220;That reminds me: I can remember
you and the others pulling us out of the crevice&mdash;Hartridge
and me&mdash;and after that, a stretcher
was made for Hartridge and we used up an age or
so getting back to the glade. Am I right, so far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was something like that; yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when we came into the old burying-ground
the motor-car had been run down opposite
the tool-house, and its headlamps made
everything look ghastly. The judge was sitting
on the door-step with his face hidden in his hands,
and Rucker&#8217;s cot was standing in the open under
the lights with a blanketed corpse lying upon it.
Who was the dead man, Poictiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax shook his head. &#8220;Call it a bad dream,&#8221;
he said soothingly. &#8220;The cracked skull was beginning
to get in its work. You didn&#8217;t see any
dead man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon closed his eyes wearily. &#8220;It&#8217;s passing
strange how a little knock on the head can
mix things. I could swear that I saw the judge
and the dead man and the car just as I have described
them. Let it go, and tell me about Richardia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax seemed suddenly embarrassed. &#8220;I&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know as there is much to tell,&#8221; he stammered.
&#8220;She&mdash;she is well, I believe.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>Tregarvon raised himself on an elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re keeping something back,&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;Is she&mdash;is she&mdash;married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; nothing of that sort,&#8221; was the hasty
reply. &#8220;She has been here to see you&mdash;she and
her father&mdash;quite often; that is, as often as possible.
I have fetched them in the car, you know.
They have left nothing undone that could be
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon still felt the presence of a reservation;
of many of them; but he was too weak to
fight for the clearer explication.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is Hartridge getting along?&#8221; he asked,
sinking back upon the pillows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather slowly. It was a bad fracture. But
the doctor says he won&#8217;t be a cripple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I want him to get well so that
I can drag him into court. He set the leaf fire
that blew us up. Did you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The golden youth nodded gravely. &#8220;I know a
good many things that I didn&#8217;t know before you
got your knockout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me down to date,&#8221; said the sick man
impatiently. &#8220;What have you done about the
mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax seemed to welcome the change to the
more material field.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>&#8220;Any number of things,&#8221; he answered cheerfully.
&#8220;In the first place we&mdash;the judge and I&mdash;swore
everybody to secrecy on that Monday
night of smashing catastrophes, and the secret
has been kept from the world at large, and from
Consolidated Coal in particular. The wrecked
drilling plant has been left just as it was; your
laboring force has been discharged; and the impression
has been given that if you ever recovered
your wits, you&#8217;d go straight away back to Philadelphia,
a sadder and much wiser young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; approved the listener. &#8220;But that isn&#8217;t
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a jugful. Two days after you were
hurt, Wilmerding resigned from the C. C. &amp; I.
service and disappeared. He has been North
buying machinery and material and shipping it
in as far as Hesterville by littles. The explanation
given and accepted is that a new company
has been formed to develop some coal lands in
the Hesterville vicinity, and the C. C. &amp; I. people
are running around in circles and uttering
loud cries in their effort to find out where the
lands are and who is going to develop them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&mdash;ripping good!&#8221; the sick man applauded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been only waiting for you to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
upon your feet, and we didn&#8217;t wish to give Thaxter
and his backers any chance to tangle things
for you in the meantime. The moment you are
able to take hold you will find everything in train&mdash;material
and machinery where you can rush it
in with motor-trucks, labor all engaged, coke-burners
from Pennsylvania ready to take the first
train south, and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon doubled the pillows under his head
and his eyes were flashing. &#8220;Poictiers, you&#8217;re a
miracle!&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>The professional idler smiled his denial. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t do any of it. I merely stood aside and told
the others to go ahead and we&#8217;d pay the bills.
Wilmerding was fully competent to take charge
of the business part of it, and I have retained old
Captain Duncan for the engineering. All you
have to do now is to rise up and say the word,
and you&#8217;ll have a mine that will make the Whitlow
proposition compare accurately with a last
year&#8217;s almanac.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon closed his eyes again and kept them
closed so long as to give the impression that he
had fallen asleep. But when Carfax was about
to tiptoe away the heavy-lidded eyes opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll build upon the foundation you have laid,
Poictiers; you and Wilmerding and Duncan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
There are three things that I mean to do before
I quit and go West to look for another job: to
stand the Ocoee upon its feet as a paying proposition,
to make provision for my mother and
sister with a part of the property and to divide
the remainder equitably among those who were
frozen out in the Parker robbery, and after this
is done to turn heaven and earth over until I
have found and punished the man or men who
have tried so hard to smash me. When I&#8217;ve
squared up I&#8217;ll vanish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax laid a hand as slender and shapely as a
woman&#8217;s upon the hot forehead. &#8220;I&#8217;ve let you
talk too much and you are getting the &#8216;wheels&#8217;
again,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be vindictive;
and there is no reason on earth why you
should talk of throwing things up and running
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are good reasons for both,&#8221; was the
stubborn insistence. &#8220;I owe it to common justice,
no less than to myself, to dig up the criminal
or criminals and bring them to book. If they
should prove to be Thaxter and his backers, after
all, the world needs the example; and if it was
pure outlawry on the part of the McNabbs and
Hartridge and some other scoundrel that McNabb
wouldn&#8217;t name there is all the more reason why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
I should send for the best detectives the country
affords and run the outlaws down. And as to
running away after it is all over, that says itself,
Poictiers. I couldn&#8217;t stay on here after Richardia
is married to another man. It isn&#8217;t in human
nature. Now go away and let me sleep. I want
to hurry and get well, so that I can stand up and
straighten things out.&#8221;</p>

<small>A Grounded Wire</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE small world of Coalville, centring socially
under Tait&#8217;s store porch, had its
vivifying shock when it awoke one morning to
find that in a single night, as one might say, the
entire face of nature had changed for the sleepy
little hamlet at the foot of old Pisgah. In the
instant of transformation the Ocoee of many
disappointments had suddenly leaped into the
foreground as a coal discovery of unlimited possibilities;
an army of workmen was massing to
shift the old tramway to the new opening; motor-trucks,
piled high with material, were trundling
over the valley pike from Hesterville; carpenters
were rushing up new buildings at top speed; and
at the centre of all these stirring activities, directing
and driving them, was the young man
whom rumor had been bulletining as dead or dying
in his room on the second floor of the old office-building,
or at best destined to pass the remainder
of his life in an asylum.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>Taking one thing with another, the gossips at
Tait&#8217;s found it difficult to recognize the convalescent
Tregarvon. The brief period of his
illness had seemed to mature him curiously; to
make him a man of a single idea&mdash;the idea being
to turn the Ocoee into a producing industry in
the shortest possible time. Also, they missed
the genial and mollifying influence of the young
New York millionaire, who, though still nominally
an inmate of the Ocoee headquarters building,
spent most of his time on the mountain, presumably
as a guest of the Caswells.</p>

<p>As it chanced, the store-porch gossips were not
the only persons who were finding a changed
Tregarvon sitting at the desk of overlordship
in the hastily remodelled Ocoee office-building.
There were others, among them Barnby, travelling
freight agent for the railroad, who had come all
the way from his own headquarters to find out
why the Ocoee was hauling its new material from
Hesterville in motor-trucks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find the reason in the correspondence
files of your general office,&#8221; was the curt reply of
the Ocoee organizer. &#8220;I asked for a rate from
Hesterville to Coalville on the material and was
told that the shortage of cars would make it impossible
for your road to handle the freight save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>
as it might be transported a little at a time by
the daily way-train. I don&#8217;t propose to be held
up by a railroad company, the policy of which
seems to be dictated by the C. C. &amp; I., Mr.
Barnby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnby was a fleshy young man with an easy
smile, and he gave the smile its blandishing opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to ship your product out over
our road when you get in operation, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
he asked mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily. We have all the capital we
need, and if you don&#8217;t give us an equal show with
the C. C. &amp; I. we shall build a ten-mile industrial
track, for which we have already secured a
right of way, to a connection with the South Central
at Midvale. It&#8217;s up to your people. Talk
it over with them when you go back to headquarters.
Glad to have met you. Drop in again
when you are going over the line. Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Touching this intimation that the coal trust
had already begun a new series of impeding
activities, speculation was rife. Some said that
the C. C. &amp; I. would buy the new mine, lock,
stock, and barrel, and close it; others hinted that
the trust would put the price of coke so low that
the new company would be bankrupted in short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
order; still others suggested that Consolidated
Coal would conspire with the railroad and call
Tregarvon&#8217;s bluff to build the industrial cut-off.</p>

<p>Wilmerding or Duncan, or both of them, brought
these rumors to Tregarvon, and were amazed to
find that he refused to be either disturbed or
greatly interested. In many ways the superintendent
and the old Scotch engineer were discovering
daily that they had to do with a man who
had developed suddenly into a master of himself
and others. The light-hearted young fellow who
had thrown himself so joyously into the fray at
the beginning had given place to a modern captain
of industry, alert, strong-willed, a bit dictatorial,
perhaps, but entirely capable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind what the C. C. &amp; I. is doing, or
will try to do,&#8221; he told his oddly assorted lieutenants.
&#8220;Our job is to get the mine open and
the ovens fired. Consolidated Coal will neither
buy us nor break us, nor force us to build a railroad
to Midvale. I&#8217;ll take care of all those details
at the proper time.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was on the day when the first tram loads of
Ocoee coal were coming down the mountain to be
dumped into the oven-filling hoppers that another
caller discovered the new Tregarvon. Late in
the afternoon a neat, rubber-tired buggy, drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>
by a black Hambletonian, stopped in front of the
Ocoee office-building, and a round-bodied little
man descended and hitched the horse.</p>

<p>Somewhat to his chagrin, it may be supposed,
Mr. Onias Thaxter was allowed to cool his heels
for a full quarter of an hour in the outer office
before he was admitted to the presence of the new
overlord; and the waiting was doubtless the
harder to endure since he came bearing the olive-branch
of peace. Tregarvon sat back in his
chair and listened coldly while the peace branch
was getting itself waved to an accompaniment of
placative speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no such thing as personal vindictiveness
in business, Mr. Tregarvon,&#8221; was the summing-up
of the Thaxter argument. &#8220;Without
admitting it as a fact, let us assume, for the moment,
that the man Sawyer was employed as a
sort of scout for our people. This is a thing
that is done every day; it&#8217;s business, and good
business. You might do it yourself, if you had a
competitor. We are hearing it asserted here and
there and everywhere that you are charging us
with a lot of outlawry with which we had nothing
to do, and that you are going to press the charges
in the courts. Will you pardon me if I say that
that isn&#8217;t playing the game?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>&#8220;You may say anything you wish to say, if
you will only make it sufficiently brief,&#8221; was the
discouraging rejoinder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already made my suggestion. It must
be evident to you that a consolidation of interests
with us is by far the most sensible plan you can
adopt. You can hardly hope to do business
here, as an independent coal operator, in the heart
of a region which we have developed. There
would be constant friction; in the market, with
your labor, with the transportation companies.
I am not authorized to make a definite proposal,
but if you will organize your new company on a
conservative basis with a modest capitalization, I
feel sure that our people would take you in as a
subsidiary, share for share at par value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite through?&#8221; asked the new
Tregarvon, when the emissary paused to take
breath. &#8220;If you are, you may have my answer
in one word&mdash;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you are deciding too hastily, and
because you haven&#8217;t given the plan sufficient
thought. As I have pointed out, there is no such
thing as vindictiveness in business; but when you
deliberately set up that standard for yourself, you
mustn&#8217;t expect the other fellow to lie down and
let you run the truck-wheels over him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>&#8220;By which you mean that if I refuse to let you
swallow me peaceably, you will do it the other
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is your own deduction&mdash;not mine,&#8221; said
the bookkeeper in the tone of one trying to soothe
a wayward child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then listen to me, Mr. Thaxter. Some
scoundrels&mdash;possibly you and your people&mdash;have
harried me like a lot of pirates. Nothing has been
left undone in the effort either to swindle me out
of my property on the one hand, or to force me
out of it on the other. But now the shoe is on
the other foot&#8221;&mdash;he was leaning across the corner
of the desk and emphasizing the words with a
clenched fist beating softly upon the oak&mdash;&#8220;we
have Sawyer where we can make him talk. We
know that he can implicate you, individually, in
one of the criminalities; and perhaps he can tell
us something about the others. Mr. Thaxter, I
am going to sift these bushwhackings to the bottom,
and you know best whether or not you or
the combination you represent can afford to heap
more fuel on the fire now by fighting me in the
manner you have suggested. That is all I have
to say, I believe, and I shall have to ask you to
excuse me. This is my busy day.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the early evening of the fourth day after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
Thaxter&#8217;s visit, Carfax made one of his infrequent
descents of the mountain, driving a ridiculously
high-priced car, the purchasing of which
had been his latest extravagance. The coke-ovens
in the long rank were aglow with the fires
of the initial charging, and the air of the valley
was murky with the smoke of the new industry.
Wilmerding and Duncan were at the mine, and
Tregarvon had just finished his dinner when Carfax
entered the dining-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do turn up once in a while, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
said the solitary diner not too hospitably. &#8220;You&#8217;re
late for dinner, but doubtless Uncle William can
find you something. You will have to eat alone.
I have some work to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax followed the worker into the front office
and, when the lights were turned on, dropped into
a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any dinner,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Or
rather I should say, I&#8217;m due to show up at Mrs.
Caswell&#8217;s at the proper dinner-hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon had a telegraph pad under his hand
and he took time to write a brief message before
he said, half-absently: &#8220;We keep working-men&#8217;s
hours here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is a delicate way of intimating that
I&#8217;d better go chase myself and quit bothering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
you?&#8221; put in the intruder with a gentle chuckle.
&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll vanish presently. But first I&#8217;d
like to ask if you are still clinging to your fantastic
idea of making somebody suffer for the dynamiting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am; and I don&#8217;t see anything fantastic
about it. A number of crimes have been committed,
and I have no notion of compounding a
felony by letting the perpetrators get away.
Morgan McNabb is the key to the situation, and
I have never understood why you and Judge
Birrell turned him loose and gave him a chance
to disappear. It has cost me a pretty penny to
trace him, but I&#8217;ve got him now. He is under
arrest in Dallas, Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are going to have him brought back
and given the third degree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. I have just written the telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax was feeling in his pockets for his cigarette-case,
going about it leisurely as one who
would gain time.</p>

<p>&#8220;McNabb is only a poor devil of a mountaineer,
too ignorant to be held fully accountable, don&#8217;t
you think?&#8221; he ventured at the match-lighting.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be. But he knows the real criminal
or criminals who employed him. I&#8217;ve been an
easy mark all my life, Poictiers, but that is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
thing of the past now. I&#8217;ve turned over a new
leaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>The golden youth was blowing delicate little
smoke rings at the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have, and the new leaf isn&#8217;t as pleasant
reading as some of the old ones, Vance,&#8221; he commented,
speaking slowly and without a trace of
the lisp. &#8220;Some of the things you are writing
down on it are rather sordid, don&#8217;t you think?
You are a bigger man in some ways, and a much
smaller one in some others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Faithful are the wounds of a friend,&#8217;&#8221;
quoted the one under criticism with a short
laugh. &#8220;Suppose you elucidate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will. Up to the time of your father&#8217;s death
you were as much of a <i>fl&acirc;neur</i> as I&#8217;ve always been.
You didn&#8217;t have to ask for your blessings; you
merely reached out and took them&mdash;if they didn&#8217;t
happen to be handed you on a silver platter.
During the past few months you&#8217;ve been chucked
up against life as it really is for the greater part
of mankind; a fight, a frantic scramble for a
foothold. You&#8217;ve made the fight, because you
have the good old Cornish fighting blood in you;
but while you have been growing on one side you
have been shrinking on the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>&#8220;Real magnanimity was one of the strongest
and most lovable qualities of the man you&#8217;ve put
off; you&#8217;ve lost it completely. Cheerful optimism
was one of the other good points, and you&#8217;ve
dropped it. Just now you are planning first to
get square with your enemies, and next to shirk
your responsibilities by effacing yourself. What
have you done about the new incorporation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done exactly what I told you I should.
The new company is formed, and the papers for
the division of the capital stock are prepared.
I am looking for Peters, the family lawyer, on
every train, and when he comes the deal will be
closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tried to tell me the other day what the
property arrangement is to be, but I didn&#8217;t get
it very clearly fixed in my mind,&#8221; Carfax offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is simple. Since you say you don&#8217;t want any
of the stock, you will be reimbursed for your cash
advances out of the first money earned by the
mine. The stock is to be divided, sixty per cent
to my mother and sister and forty to Judge
Birrell for distribution among the original minority
stockholders who were swindled out of their
holdings by Parker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Parker,&#8221; said Carfax musingly. &#8220;He will
never swindle any more. Did I tell you? I read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>
an item in the New York <i>Times</i>. Parker was
found dead at his desk in his Broad Street office
one day last week.&#8221; Then he came back to the
matter in hand. &#8220;Where do you come in, in the
property distribution?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t come in; I go out. Wilmerding and
Duncan can operate the mine, and I shan&#8217;t be
needed. I shall go West and try for an engineering
job in one of the gold camps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not before you have had your revenge
upon the dynamiters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I shall stay long enough to see that part
of it through to a finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are proving my contention very handsomely,
don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; said the critic quietly;
&#8220;that you are bigger in some ways and smaller in
others? You are telling yourself that this generous
thing you are going to do is perfectly magnanimous,
and that you are merely raising the
magnanimity to the <i>nth</i> power by conserving the
ends of pure justice in the prosecution part of it,
and by obliterating yourself afterward. But,
really, at the bottom of it all there are two rather
dismal motives. You want your revenge, and
you wish to show the woman in the case that you
can turn your back upon her without half trying.
Isn&#8217;t that true?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>Tregarvon&#8217;s grin bordered upon the saturnine.
&#8220;It&#8217;s next to impossible to resent anything you
choose to say, Poictiers; that is your one little
gift&mdash;to be able to flay your friends without getting
yourself disliked. Let&#8217;s talk of something
else. How long is Elizabeth going to stay at
Judge Birrell&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the golden youth was able to call up
the cherubic smile in all its glory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very much longer now. She, too, is going
West.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Elizabeth? You don&#8217;t know her as
well as I do. Her &#8216;West&#8217; begins and ends at the
summit of the Alleghenies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, she is planning to make the
grand tour&mdash;in a private car.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon reached suddenly across the corner
of the table-desk and grasped the hand of many
helpings.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is enough of the old Vance Tregarvon
left in me to wish you all the joy there is in the
world, Poictiers!&#8221; he exclaimed, with some touch
of the old-time heartiness. &#8220;You two were made
for each other; I can see it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite sure there aren&#8217;t any inward
daggerings behind that, Vance?&#8221; said the successful
one half wistfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>&#8220;Not in the least. I&#8217;m glad. If you or Elizabeth
had only told me at first who the other fellow
was ... but it is all right now. How did
you contrive to persuade her to overlook your
bit of play-acting with Richardia?&#8221;</p>

<p>The persuader shook his head. &#8220;That part of it
was pretty serious. It was one of the things
that couldn&#8217;t very well be explained in cold words.
I think Miss Richardia has helped out some.
She knew well enough what I did it for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t do it for me,&#8221; Tregarvon interposed
bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; was the quiet rejoinder. &#8220;As I
have said before, I assumed most naturally that
Elizabeth&#8217;s happiness was involved, and I didn&#8217;t
propose to stand by and see you make ducks and
drakes of it if I could help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind; it&#8217;s all over now, and you two
at least are in a fair way to get what is coming
to you. How is Hartridge getting along by this
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite well. He is walking with a crutch, and
is able to hear his classes.&#8221; So much Carfax said
in the matter-of-fact manner of one who answers
a commonplace categorically. Then he sat up
suddenly and snapped his fingers, and the lisping
drawl had returned when he went on: &#8220;By Jove!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span>
that reminds me, don&#8217;t you know. Hartridge
would like to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does he wish to see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax spread his hands. &#8220;My dear boy, I&#8217;m
no mind-reader. But I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s rather urgent.
Will you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon sat frowning down upon the papers
on the desk for a full half-minute before he looked
up to say: &#8220;I can&#8217;t go, Poictiers. I don&#8217;t care
especially to meet Hartridge, or to listen to the
begging-off plea which he is probably going to
make. He as good as told me that he was jealous,
and was trying to get square. Besides, I haven&#8217;t
seen Richardia since this mad-work whirl began,
and&mdash;and it will be easier for me if I don&#8217;t see
her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax had his answer ready. &#8220;You&#8217;ll not
meet Richardia at Highmount. Elizabeth is
staying with the Caswells for a few days, and
Richardia went home to Westwood House at
three o&#8217;clock. I know, because I drove her in
my car. Hartridge has his rooms in the laboratory
building, and you needn&#8217;t show up at the
president&#8217;s house at all if you don&#8217;t wish to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon hesitated a moment and then
glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go&mdash;a little later,&#8221; he decided abruptly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I owe the professor anything
but an action at law for helping to destroy my
drilling plant, but I&#8217;ll give him a chance to say
what he has to say. Now run along and keep
your dinner engagement. I can drive up in my
own car when I am ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what time will that be?&#8221; queried Carfax,
hanging upon the threshold of the door of
leave-takings. &#8220;I ought to let Hartridge know
when to expect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Tregarvon looked at his watch. &#8220;Say
eight o&#8217;clock. Will that do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly, I should think.&#8221; It was the
golden youth&#8217;s cue to disappear, but still he lingered.
&#8220;That telegram you have just written,
Vance; are you going to send it to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon answered without looking up. &#8220;Certainly.
And to-morrow I shall notify the sheriff
to send a deputy after McNabb.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carfax went out, closing the door softly behind
him. But when the big expensive motor-car had
cut its half-circle to head toward the mountain
pike it was brought to a stand at the railroad
station, and the driver left it for a minute or two
while he had speech through the ticket-window
with Orcutt, the night telegraph operator. Daddy
Layne, with nothing better to do, was warming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>
his shins at the waiting-room stove, and though he
listened, after the manner of his kind, he caught
only one sentence of the low-toned talk. That
was Orcutt&#8217;s, spoken after Layne&#8217;s keen old eyes
had glimpsed the passing of something that looked
like a yellow-backed bank-note through the window.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll be as much as my job&#8217;s worth, Mr.
Carfax, but I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half-hour later, while Layne was dozing in a
corner of the superheated waiting-room, Tregarvon
came in with his message to the Dallas chief
of police. This time there was no effort made to
keep the talk from being overheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty sorry, Mr. Tregarvon, but I can&#8217;t
get it off to-night,&#8221; was the operator&#8217;s deprecatory
protest when the message was handed in.
&#8220;The commercial wires are grounded&mdash;been that
way all the evening. Mighty sorry, but these
things will happen once in a while. Yes; sure!
first thing in the morning, if I have to put it
through the despatcher&#8217;s office. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXI<br />


<small>On Pisgah&#8217;s Height</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROFESSOR William Wilberforce Hartridge
was reading before the cheerful grate fire in
his sitting-room when his visitor was brought up
by the old negro janitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Mr. Tregarvon, and be at home,&#8221;
he said, rising, with the aid of his crutch, for the
welcoming, and making difficult work of it. &#8220;Draw
your chair to the fire and be comfortable. It
was kind of you to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carfax brought me your message,&#8221; Tregarvon
interrupted, rather more brusquely than he
meant to. &#8220;In a certain sense I suppose I am
responsible for your present condition, and since
you wished to see me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; but I didn&#8217;t wish to give myself the
opportunity of reproaching you for the accident,
I assure you,&#8221; was the deprecatory rejoinder.
&#8220;You were not even constructively to blame for
my cowardly legs.&#8221; Then he added, with a touch
of na&iuml;ve humor: &#8220;I trust they have sufficiently
learned their lesson.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span>&#8220;You are having a pretty long siege of it,&#8221;
Tregarvon offered, finding himself sympathizing
where he had meant to be coldly self-contained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old bones,&#8221; returned the schoolmaster, with
his quaint smile. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t knitted quite
as rapidly as they might. But let us hope that
there is nothing worse than broken bones in
store for any of us. May I be very frank with
you, Mr. Tregarvon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall set you the example. I can conceive
of only one reason why you should wish to see
me, Mr. Hartridge. You have been told that I
am still determined to exact an eye for an eye in
the matter of bringing certain criminals to justice,
and you would like to forestall your arrest
as an accessory. Am I right?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the quaint smile became quizzical.
&#8220;Partly; but only partly. Have you taken any
steps as yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have. After a good bit of trouble and expense
I have at last succeeded in tracing the man
Morgan McNabb. He is under arrest in Dallas,
Texas, and I shall have him brought back as soon
as the necessary papers can be obtained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your object in bringing him back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is to make him give the name of the man who
hired him to put the dynamite under my drilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
plant. That man is going to the penitentiary,
Mr. Hartridge, if any effort of mine can send him
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The schoolmaster removed his spectacles to
polish them, and for a time sat staring with unshielded
eyes into the heart of the coal fire in the
grate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have all the precedents on your side,&#8221;
he admitted at length. &#8220;It is your right to prosecute
if you choose to do so. Yet I venture to
predict that you will be exceedingly sorry if you
bring Morgan McNabb to Tennessee and extort
his confession&mdash;a confession which will necessarily
be made public. Besides, there is a much easier
way in which you can apprehend his principal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you willing to indicate the way?&#8221; snapped
Tregarvon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not altogether willing; no. You are at heart
a much flintier young man than you appeared to
be when we first met, Mr. Tregarvon. It is an
inheritance from some one of your Cornish forebears,
I imagine. But I have allowed myself to
be overpersuaded. You have your car here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall ask you to drive me. Will you trust me
that far?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon rose, smiling grimly. &#8220;I shall have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
you for my hostage. If you are about to have
me ambushed, I shall make you share my risk.
Do we go at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hartridge limped to a closet and found his overcoat,
and Tregarvon helped him to put it on.
Then he gave the temporary cripple an arm
through the laboratory corridor and down the
stair. At the steps he lifted Hartridge bodily
into the mechanician&#8217;s seat of the car. As yet
there had been no hint given of their destination,
but when he took his place behind the wheel
Tregarvon asked for driving directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Westward, on the cross-mountain road,&#8221; was
the brief reply, and no other word was exchanged
until the swiftly driven machine was approaching
the intersection of the cross-road with the west-brow
pike. Then Hartridge said: &#8220;To your left,&#8221;
and Tregarvon had a sudden sinking of the heart.
A mile away he could see the lights of Westwood
House, and a great fear rose up to unsteady his
hand as he made the turn out of the cross-road.</p>

<p>Tregarvon&#8217;s fear was realized in some measure
when, at Hartridge&#8217;s direction, the car made a
second left-hand turn into the Westwood grounds
and was brought to a stand before the door of the
old mansion. &#8220;I have obeyed you blindly thus
far,&#8221; he said, as he was lifting Hartridge out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>
the car. &#8220;But now you must tell me. Is it Judge
Birrell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said the schoolmaster, and Tregarvon
helped the lame man up the steps and steadied
him while he groped for the knocker. Before he
could knock, the door opened silently under the
hand of the judge&#8217;s daughter, and Tregarvon
again gave Hartridge an arm to help him over
the threshold.</p>

<p>Though the hall was but dimly lighted he saw
at once that there had been a pitiful change in
Richardia. There was the shadow of a deep grief
in her eyes when she greeted him, and the hand
that she gave him was nerveless and cold. He
had never seen her in black before, and that, and
the chill of the great hall and the grave silence of
his car companion, made him feel as if he had
entered a house of mourning.</p>

<p>Without a word in explanation the changed
Richardia led him to the stair and signed to him
to precede her. Tregarvon hesitated only long
enough to see that the professor was hobbling
away toward the lighted library. Then he stood
aside and slipped an arm under Richardia&#8217;s.
&#8220;They hadn&#8217;t told me you had been ill,&#8221; he said
reproachfully; and as they went up together the
nearness of her set his blood afire and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span>
moment he forgot the scene in the deep wood
timing itself in the Sunday afternoon of revealment.</p>

<p>At the stairhead a door stood ajar, with the
flickering light of an open fire in the room beyond
shining through the narrow opening. With a
quick premonition that a tragedy was about to
be revealed, Tregarvon followed his guide into
the room. It was a huge chamber, spacious
enough to belittle the few pieces of old-fashioned
furnishings, and in the great four-poster bed lay
a young man with an arm in a sling and his
bandaged head propped high among the pillows.
Though the face of the sick man was haggard
and emaciated, Tregarvon recognized it instantly.
It was the face of the handsome young fellow
who had kept the Sunday afternoon tryst with
Richardia.</p>

<p>It was only natural that he should be checked
by a sudden feeling of antagonism, but before it
could find expression it was swallowed up in an
astoundment too great to be measured. Richardia
had led him to the bedside and she was saying
quietly: &#8220;Mr. Tregarvon has come, brother.
Shall I leave him alone with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man roused himself with an effort
that was plainly distressful. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>
shortly. And after Richardia had gone: &#8220;I&#8217;m
the man you&#8217;re looking for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon dragged a chair to the bedside and
sat down. In the rush of conflicting emotions
one exultant fact was hammering itself into his
brain and dominating all others: Richardia&#8217;s
secret had not been her lover&#8217;s secret; it was her
<i>brother&#8217;s</i>. In the turmoil of readjustment, it was
inevitable that the generous impulses of former
days&mdash;the days before the <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>&mdash;should come
swiftly to the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to be here, Mr. Birrell; and that is
entirely apart from anything you may be going
to tell me,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;Are you quite sure
you are able to talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to talk; it&#8217;s up to me now. Sister
told me a little while ago that you had caught
Morgan McNabb; that you&#8217;re going to have
him brought back here so that you can give him
the third degree. I&#8217;m the man you want. Morgan
did only what I made him do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon was beginning to understand a little.
&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;d better tell it all, if you feel
equal to it,&#8221; he suggested soberly. Then he
added: &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be your judge, Mr.
Birrell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man rocked his head on the pillows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>&#8220;You won&#8217;t understand; I couldn&#8217;t make anybody
understand. But it&#8217;s got to be told. Do
you know what that crook Parker did to my
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; all of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it made a devil of me. I was only a
kid then, but it seemed as if I grew to be a man
between two days. I tried to kill Parker. Maybe
you know that, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I have heard about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t die; and he spent his money like
water until he got me indicted. Then I broke
my father&#8217;s heart by showing the yellow streak&mdash;running
away. I&#8217;ve been hid out down in
Arizona ever since, but I always meant to come
back and stand the gaff some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Tregarvon gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come back by the railroad. The yellow
streak showed up again, and I dodged the
sheriff by walking in over the mountain from
Piketown. The McNabbs hid me out in the
&#8216;Pocket.&#8217; They told me you were Parker&#8217;s man,
and that you had come to finish what he&#8217;d begun.
Afterward they told me you were making love to
my sister, and that settled it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Tregarvon. Then: &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you come out in the open like a man and find
out a few things for yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t. The indictment was still hanging
over me; as it is yet. And I was crazy mad.
I swore I&#8217;d run you out of the country or kill
you if you didn&#8217;t go. I made Morgan McNabb
help me. He&#8217;d been mixed up in a feud years
ago and had ambushed a man, and I was the
only one who knew it. I told him I&#8217;d give him
away if he didn&#8217;t help me run you off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister knew you had come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but she didn&#8217;t know anything else.
She thought I was afraid to show myself on account
of the old trouble&mdash;as I was. She was
trying to fix things so that I could come back
here to my father and Westwood House. I did
come, but they brought me on a stretcher. Somebody
set the leaves afire that night in the old
negro burying-ground, and the dynamite went off
and caught me while I was trying to stamp the
fire out. The jig&#8217;s up now. All you&#8217;ve got to do
is to send for the sheriff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon saw that it was time to intervene.
The sick man&#8217;s breath was coming in gasps and
his face was livid.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t try to talk any more now,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
said, rising and taking the thin hand that was so
much like Richardia&#8217;s in his own. &#8220;For a good
many reasons you have nothing to fear from me.
Of course, you know now that I am in no sense
Parker&#8217;s representative. So far from it, the papers
are already drawn which will restore to your
father and his friends the property that Parker
stole from them. I meant to do that from the
first, if I should be lucky enough to find the
coal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grip of the thin fingers tightened upon the
hand of reassurance. &#8220;My God!&#8221; breathed the
prodigal, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been trying to kill you!
Mr. Tregarvon, can you go one step farther and&mdash;and
turn Morgan McNabb loose? That&#8217;s
what made me frame it up with sister and Hartridge
and Mr. Carfax to bring you here to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;McNabb will not be brought back; I promise
you that. Shall I send your sister up to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not right now; tell her to play something;
something low and soft that&#8217;ll make the
devil let me alone. I want to think. I&mdash;I reckon
I&#8217;m willing to go to the convict camps now for
trying to square up with Parker; I reckon I
<i>ought</i> to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon went out softly, closing the door
behind him and groping his way down the stair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
Richardia was waiting for him in the hall below,
as he hoped she would be, and she led him across
to the drawing-room where there were lights and
a wood-fire purring and crackling in the big stone
fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she entreated.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to tell&mdash;nothing that you
haven&#8217;t already guessed. I am completely disarmed,
as you knew I would be. I have assured
your brother that he has nothing to fear from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been very dreadful,&#8221; she said, moving
aside to hold her hands out to the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;How badly was he hurt in the explosion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So badly that it is only within the past few
days that we have dared to hope. Mr. Carfax
hasn&#8217;t told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word. Your secret has been guarded
very carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now it is a secret no longer. If he gets
well it will only be to face a trial for the attempt
upon Mr. Parker&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing will come of that,&#8221; Tregarvon predicted
confidently. &#8220;Parker is dead; he died
suddenly in his New York office a few days ago.
And no twelve Tennesseeans could ever be found
who would convict your brother for trying to
avenge his father&#8217;s wrongs.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>&#8220;We are your poor debtors&mdash;all of us,&#8221; she went
on. &#8220;You are heaping coals of fire on our heads,
and&mdash;and they <i>burn</i>! Of course, you know now
that I was my brother&#8217;s accomplice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of the sort; of course, you
were not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I was&mdash;in a way. All along, I feared that
it was he who was making, or at least planning, all
the trouble you were having. He was <i>so</i> bitter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon nodded complete comprehension.
&#8220;I knew you were anxious about somebody; I
thought, at first, that it was Hartridge, and later
that it was your father. You have had a heavy
burden to carry; and I have been doing what I
could to make it heavier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have,&#8221; she said quite frankly.</p>

<p>He did not affect to misunderstand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew all the time that Poictiers and
Elizabeth were held apart only by Elizabeth&#8217;s
engagement to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed it. But that didn&#8217;t excuse you for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For making love to you? I know it didn&#8217;t.
But I had my punishment the Sunday afternoon
when you met your brother in the wood above the
&#8216;Pocket.&#8217; I had gone out to meet Hartridge, and I
saw you two together. I took it for granted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
the man was your lover who, for some reason,
couldn&#8217;t come here to Westwood House to meet
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Others took it for granted, too, and I did not
deny it&mdash;for Richard&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is his name Richard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Richard and Richardia. My father
named us so, after a brother and sister of his own
who were twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tregarvon glanced at his watch. There were
other things to be said&mdash;many of them, but a suddenly
recrudescent sense of the fitness of things
told him that the moment was unauspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll have to consider Hartridge and
take him back to Highmount,&#8221; he offered. Then
he added quite irrelevantly: &#8220;He&#8217;s in love with
you, too. Speaking of accomplices, how much
or how little did he have to do with the bushwhacking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all. It was only on the day of
the explosion that he learned that Richard had
come back, and was hiding with the McNabbs
in the &#8216;Pocket,&#8217; and heard, through Sill McNabb,
that something was going to happen that night
at your drilling plant. He suspected Richard at
once, and went over to try to prevent the happening.
Then your men caught Morgan McNabb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span>
and Professor Billy hardly knew what to do. He
guessed that Tryon had come over here after you
and Mr. Carfax, and when you took father back
with you he was afraid Morgan would be made to
confess, and so make a bad matter infinitely
worse. His idea in lighting the leaf fire was to
give Morgan McNabb a chance to escape. Of
course, he supposed the dynamite had been removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a tragedy of errors from the beginning,&#8221;
said Tregarvon soberly. &#8220;But I am
going to expiate my part of it. Has Poictiers told
you anything about my plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made them while I was lying in bed in the
old office-building at Coalville, trying to get well
enough to crawl out and take hold with my hands.
It came to me then what an egregious ass I had
made of myself, all the way round. I had blundered
in ahead of Poictiers and didn&#8217;t have sense
enough even to suspect it; and I had deliberately
killed any little regard you might have had for
me by showing myself up as a man who would
make love to one woman while he was engaged to
another. I was eaten up with shame, Richardia,
and I am yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hurt me; I think you will never know how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span>
much it hurt,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;A man asks
utter and absolute loyalty of the woman he
loves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the woman can ask no less of the man,
you would say. That is true. I am no defender
of the double standard; still less an apologist for
my sex. I have only one excuse, Richardia; it
wasn&#8217;t merely propinquity&mdash;as you and Poictiers
seemed to think. I had never known what love
was until I met you. Elizabeth is going to marry
Poictiers, and you must believe me when I say that
I think just as much of her&mdash;and in the same way&mdash;as
I did before. But let that pass. I had found
my coal mine, and had lost pretty nearly everything
else, including my own self-respect. You
were lost to me; doubly lost, as I thought then; so
it seemed that the only thing for me to do was to
set the Ocoee house in order, and after that was
done to go away and try to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still meaning to go away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I meant to stay long enough to make
somebody suffer for the bushwhackings, but that
is past. I have sent for Peters, our family lawyer,
and when he comes we shall settle the property
affair. Three-fifths of the stock in the mine will
go to my mother and sister, and the remainder
will be turned over to your father to be distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>
among the Parker victims. This is what I have
been meaning to do all along, if I should be fortunate
enough to discover the coal.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;You are reckoning without
my father. He won&#8217;t take the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be made to take it. It is only just
and fair. When it comes to that, you must help
me, Richardia; for his sake and for your brother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Dick!&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;He needs a
friend much more than he needs the money;
some one who would care enough for him to stand
by and hold him up to the best there is in him.
There <i>is</i> good in him; you may not believe it
now, but there is, really&mdash;lots of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can very readily believe it, since he is your
brother and the son of your father. And he has
proved it to-night by climbing into the breach
for McNabb. He will have his chance on the
Ocoee, and Wilmerding will be his friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are determined to go away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I owe it to you and to everybody else,
not less than to myself. But some day, Richardia,
after I have done penance for the sin of loving
you before I had a right to I am coming back.
But I had forgotten; your brother wished me to
ask you to play for him; something that would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>
drive the devil away. He said he wanted to
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the piano at once. Alone among the
old-fashioned house furnishings it was modern;
an artist&#8217;s instrument, full-toned and responsive.
Tregarvon sank into an armchair before the
blazing logs and gave himself up to the quiet
ecstasies of the music-lover. From the first her
playing had stirred him as no other chamber-music
ever had. For a time he knew that she was
improvising; then there were gentle themes
from Mendelssohn, shading one into another so
deftly that he could never mark the changes.
And at the last there was the Chopin nocturne.</p>

<p>While the closing chords of the night-song were
still lingering in the air she came to sit in a chair
at the opposite corner of the hearth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You played the Chopin for me; was that your
way of telling me that I might come back some
day, Richardia?&#8221; he asked quite humbly.</p>

<p>Her hands were clasped over one knee and her
gaze was fixed upon the blue and yellow flames
in the great fireplace, when she said softly: &#8220;You
are very human&mdash;and very blind; so blind that
you haven&#8217;t seen that I have had to fight for two&mdash;for
myself no less than for you. And there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>
have been times when&mdash;when I almost <i>hated</i>
Elizabeth!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tregarvon blood was not sluggish; at
least, he had never found it so before; but for
the moment he was like a man stricken suddenly
dumb. Then the gift of speech came back,
laboring as it could in the turmoil of new ecstasies.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You had to fight for two</i>; God help me, Richardia&mdash;if
I had known that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose quickly and came to stand beside his
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had known it, you would have been
the strong one, Vance, dear. I know it; I knew
it all the time; but I&mdash;was afraid&mdash;to trust&mdash;myself.
You are not going away, now, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was the sound of an opening and closing
door and the stumping of the professor&#8217;s crutch
on the bare floor of the hall. Tregarvon sprang
up and took the small black-gowned figure in his
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going away?&#8221; he broke out passionately;
&#8220;you couldn&#8217;t drive me away with an axe! I&#8217;m
going to stay forever, and let you make a complete
man of me. We&#8217;ll <i>marry</i> your father&#8217;s share
of the Ocoee back to him, and together we&#8217;ll make
a man of your brother. There are a million other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
things to say, but Hartridge is coming to look
for his chauffeur and I must take him back to
Highmount. Richardia&mdash;sweetheart!... If I
don&#8217;t wreck the car on the way it will be a miracle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very gently she disengaged herself. &#8220;You&mdash;you
needn&#8217;t smother a person,&#8221; she protested, with
the quaint little grimace that he loved. And
then: &#8220;That is father, calling me to go to brother.
Please heap some more coals of fire and be good
to Professor Billy&mdash;for the sake of his loyalty to
me and mine.... Yes, daddy, dear; I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
